They're ego-dystonic—they horrify you precisely because they go against your values.\n• Engaging with the thoughts (analyzing, seeking reassurance, mental checking) makes them worse. Acceptance makes them fade.\n• You can't control what thoughts pop into your head. You can only control how you respond.\n• Having a thought—any thought—doesn't make you a bad person or mean you'll act on it."

You're not evil. You're not dangerous. You have OCD, and OCD is treatable."
