A therapist without ADHD training might misattribute symptoms to anxiety, depression, or personality issues. Worse, they might use approaches that don't work for ADHD brains, like suggesting \"just use a planner\" or \"try harder to focus.\" An ADHD-informed therapist understands how the ADHD brain works and uses evidence-based strategies tailored to your neurology."
