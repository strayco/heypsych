But it's not a replacement for medication or therapy for moderate-to-severe depression.\n\n**Best approach:** Combine exercise, therapy, and medication as needed. Work with your healthcare provider to find the right combination for you."

    "conclusion": "Exercise works for depression—the research is clear. But oversimplified headlines do a disservice by suggesting people should choose between exercise and evidence-based treatments. The real message: add movement to your mental health toolkit, whether or not you're also taking medication."
