  "clinical_interpretations": {
    "Minimal": "Your score indicates minimal depression symptoms. This suggests you are experiencing few if any depressive symptoms that interfere with your daily life. Continue with healthy lifestyle practices including regular exercise, adequate sleep, social connections, and stress management techniques.",
    "Mild": "Your score suggests mild depression symptoms that may occasionally affect your daily activities. Consider implementing self-care strategies such as regular physical activity, maintaining social connections, practicing stress reduction techniques, and ensuring adequate sleep. If symptoms persist for more than two weeks or worsen, consider consulting with a healthcare professional.",
    "Moderate": "Your score indicates moderate depression that is likely impacting your daily functioning and quality of life. It is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and discussion of treatment options. Effective treatments may include counseling, psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, medication.",
    "Moderately severe": "Your score suggests moderately severe depression that is significantly affecting your daily life and well-being. Professional evaluation and treatment are strongly recommended. Depression at this level typically responds well to treatment, which may include psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of both, along with lifestyle support strategies.",
    "Severe": "Your score indicates severe depression that is substantially impairing your ability to function in daily activities. Immediate consultation with a healthcare professional is strongly recommended for comprehensive evaluation and treatment planning. Severe depression is highly treatable with appropriate professional care, and early intervention can significantly improve outcomes and quality of life."
