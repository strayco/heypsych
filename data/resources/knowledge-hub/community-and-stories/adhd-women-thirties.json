    "introduction": "I spent three decades thinking I was just bad at being an adult. Bad at keeping my apartment clean, terrible at remembering appointments, always losing my keys. I was smart—I had a master's degree—but I felt like I was constantly failing at basic life tasks. Then, at 34, I was diagnosed with ADHD. Suddenly, everything made sense.",

        "heading": "The Signs I Missed",
        "content": "Growing up: I was the \"dreamy\" kid, lost in thought. I wasn't disruptive, so no one thought ADHD. Teachers said I \"wasn't living up to my potential\" but I worked so hard. I just couldn't focus.\n\nIn college: All-nighters to finish papers I'd known about for weeks. Brilliant in class discussions, terrible at turning in assignments. Everyone said I was \"scatterbrained\" or \"creative chaos.\"\n\nAs an adult: Constant overwhelm. Couldn't keep up with housework. Would hyperfocus on projects then abandon them. Chronic lateness despite trying everything. Emotional dysregulation nobody understood."

        "heading": "Why Women Get Diagnosed Late",
        "content": "Girls internalize symptoms: We daydream instead of disrupting. We develop coping mechanisms early (excessive list-making, people-pleasing). We're socialized to hide struggles.\n\nThe hyperactive stereotype: ADHD was defined by how it looks in boys—climbing furniture, can't sit still. Girls present differently.\n\nMasking: We work three times as hard to appear \"normal.\" By the time we burn out, we've been compensating for decades.\n\nMisdiagnosis: My ADHD was called anxiety and depression for years. Those were symptoms, not the root cause."

        "heading": "The Diagnosis Process",
        "content": "After a particularly bad month where I forgot my nephew's birthday, locked myself out twice, and missed an important deadline, I finally asked my therapist about ADHD. She referred me to a psychiatrist who specialized in adult ADHD. Three appointments later: combined type ADHD, moderate to severe.\n\nI cried. Not sad tears—relief. I wasn't lazy or broken. My brain was just wired differently."

        "heading": "Life After Diagnosis",
        "content": "Medication: Started on low-dose Adderall XR. The first day, I could choose what to focus on. I could finish tasks. I could think in straight lines. It felt like glasses for my brain.\n\nTherapy: ADHD-specific CBT helped me build systems that work with my brain, not against it.\n\nAccommodations: I got workplace accommodations. Flexible deadlines, written instructions, permission to use headphones. I stopped feeling ashamed for needing them.\n\nSelf-compassion: This was the hardest. Unlearning decades of \"you're just not trying hard enough\" messaging."

        "heading": "What I Wish I Knew Sooner",
        "content": "• ADHD in women looks different than the stereotypes\n• Struggling doesn't mean you're failing—it might mean you're neurodivergent\n• Asking for help is not weakness\n• Medication isn't \"cheating\"—it's accessibility\n• Diagnosis isn't an excuse; it's an explanation and a path forward\n• You're not alone. So many women get diagnosed in their 30s, 40s, even 50s"

        "heading": "To Other Women Wondering",
        "content": "If this sounds familiar, talk to a healthcare provider who understands adult ADHD in women. Bring your childhood report cards. Describe how hard you work just to appear functional. Explain the constant mental exhaustion.\n\nYou deserve answers. You deserve support. And you deserve to know that you're not just \"bad at life\"—you might just have an undiagnosed condition that's treatable."

    ],
    "conclusion": "Getting diagnosed with ADHD at 34 changed my life. Not because it fixed everything overnight, but because it gave me permission to stop fighting my brain and start working with it. Three years later, I'm still learning, still adjusting, but I'm no longer drowning. If you're reading this and seeing yourself, trust your instincts. You might find the answers you've been searching for."
