        "heading": "Understanding Your Coverage",
        "content": "Key terms: Deductible (amount you pay before coverage starts), Copay (fixed fee per session), Coinsurance (percentage you pay after deductible), Out-of-pocket maximum. Find out: Number of covered sessions, in-network vs. out-of-network benefits, pre-authorization requirements."

      {
        "heading": "In-Network vs. Out-of-Network",
        "content": "In-network: Lower cost, direct billing, limited provider choice. Out-of-network: More providers, higher cost, file claims yourself. Many plans cover 50-80% of out-of-network costs after deductible."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Maximizing Your Benefits",
        "content": "Tips: Verify coverage before first session. Get pre-authorization if required. Track your sessions against limits. Use HSA/FSA for copays. Request superbills for out-of-network reimbursement. Appeal denials (success rate is ~50%)."

      {
        "heading": "When Insurance Won't Cover Enough",
        "content": "Options: Sliding scale therapists, therapy training clinics, group therapy, online therapy platforms (often cheaper), EAP programs (3-8 free sessions), community mental health centers, Open Path Collective ($30-80/session)."

    "conclusion": "Insurance can significantly reduce therapy costs, but it requires navigation. Don't let insurance barriers prevent you from getting help—there are always alternatives. If you need assistance, many therapists will help you understand and maximize your benefits."
