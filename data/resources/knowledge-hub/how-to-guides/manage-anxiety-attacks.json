    "introduction": "When a panic attack strikes, your brain is convinced you're dying. Your heart pounds, you can't breathe, and everything feels surreal. But here's the truth: panic attacks, while terrifying, cannot harm you. This guide provides 10 proven techniques to manage panic in the moment, plus strategies to reduce future attacks.",

        "heading": "1. Box Breathing (The 4-4-4-4 Method)",
        "content": "How it works: Slow, controlled breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system, signaling to your body that you're safe.\n\nThe technique:\n• Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts\n• Hold for 4 counts\n• Breathe out through your mouth for 4 counts\n• Hold for 4 counts\n• Repeat 5-10 times\n\nWhy it helps: Panic causes rapid breathing (hyperventilation), which lowers CO2 levels and worsens symptoms. Box breathing restores normal levels and breaks the panic cycle.\n\nPro tip: Trace a square with your finger while breathing to give your mind something to focus on."

        "heading": "2. 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding",
        "content": "How it works: Redirects your attention from internal panic to external reality, interrupting catastrophic thoughts.\n\nThe technique:\nAcknowledge:\n• 5 things you can SEE (blue wall, coffee cup, tree outside)\n• 4 things you can TOUCH (soft fabric, cool table, your feet on the floor)\n• 3 things you can HEAR (traffic, air conditioner, birds)\n• 2 things you can SMELL (coffee, fresh air, soap)\n• 1 thing you can TASTE (mint, water, or just notice your mouth)\n\nWhy it helps: Panic exists in the future (\"What if?\"). Grounding anchors you in the present moment, where you're actually safe.\n\nVariation: Describe objects in extreme detail to yourself: \"The coffee mug is white ceramic with a small chip on the handle...\""

      {
        "heading": "3. The Cold Water Shock",
        "content": "How it works: Cold temperature triggers the dive reflex, instantly slowing your heart rate.\n\nThe techniques:\n• Splash cold water on your face\n• Hold ice cubes in your hands\n• Run cold water over your wrists\n• Place a cold pack on the back of your neck\n• Drink ice water slowly\n• Step outside into cold air\n\nWhy it helps: The dive reflex is a mammalian survival mechanism that overrides panic. It's one of the fastest ways to physiologically calm down.\n\nBest for: When your heart is racing and you need immediate physical relief."

      {
        "heading": "4. Acceptance (\"Float Through It\")",
        "content": "How it works: Counterintuitively, accepting panic instead of fighting it reduces its intensity and duration.\n\nThe technique:\n• Notice: \"I'm having a panic attack\"\n• Accept: \"This is uncomfortable but not dangerous\"\n• Float: \"I'll ride this wave until it passes\"\n• Let time pass: Don't try to force it to stop\n\nWhy it helps: Resistance creates more anxiety. When you stop fighting, panic has nothing to push against and naturally subsides.\n\nKey mindset shift: From \"How do I stop this?\" to \"How do I cope until this passes?\"\n\nMantra: \"I don't have to like this, I just have to survive it.\""

        "heading": "5. Progressive Muscle Relaxation",
        "content": "How it works: Tensing and releasing muscles discharges the physical energy of panic and teaches your body the difference between tension and relaxation.\n\nThe technique:\n• Tense your feet hard for 5 seconds, then release\n• Notice the relaxation for 10 seconds\n• Move to calves, thighs, stomach, hands, arms, shoulders, face\n• Take your time with each muscle group\n\nWhy it helps: Panic creates muscle tension. This technique gives you control over one physical symptom, which can cascade into calming others.\n\nQuick version: Tense your entire body for 5 seconds, then release everything at once."

      {
        "heading": "6. Reality Testing",
        "content": "How it works: Challenge catastrophic thoughts with evidence.\n\nCommon panic thoughts:\n❌ \"I'm having a heart attack\"\n✓ Reality: \"My heart is racing from adrenaline. I've been checked by doctors. This is panic, not danger.\"\n\n❌ \"I'm going to pass out\"\n✓ Reality: \"Panic raises blood pressure, which prevents fainting. I've never fainted from panic.\"\n\n❌ \"I'm going crazy\"\n✓ Reality: \"This is intense anxiety, not psychosis. My thoughts are scary but rational.\"\n\n❌ \"This will never end\"\n✓ Reality: \"Panic attacks peak in 10 minutes and usually resolve within 30. I've gotten through every one before.\"\n\nCreate evidence cards: Write out these reality checks and keep them on your phone for quick reference."

      {
        "heading": "7. Change Your Environment",
        "content": "How it works: Sometimes the fastest way to interrupt panic is to change your sensory input.\n\nTechniques:\n• Go outside for fresh air\n• Move to a different room\n• Turn on lights (if it's dark)\n• Open a window\n• Sit or lie down if standing\n• Remove tight clothing\n• Change position entirely\n\nWhy it helps: Your nervous system associates your current environment with danger. Changing locations can reset that association.\n\nImportant: Don't reinforce avoidance by always leaving. Sometimes stay and use other techniques."

      {
        "heading": "8. Distraction Techniques",
        "content": "How it works: Gives your brain something else to focus on while panic runs its course.\n\nEffective distractions:\n• Count backwards from 100 by 7s\n• Name every item in the room alphabetically\n• Play a game on your phone\n• Call a friend and talk about anything else\n• Do a simple task (fold laundry, organize a drawer)\n• Solve a crossword or puzzle\n• Watch a funny video\n\nWhy it helps: Panic requires mental fuel. Distraction starves it of attention.\n\nNote: Use distraction alongside, not instead of, acceptance. The goal isn't avoidance."

        "heading": "9. The \"I've Survived 100% Before\" Reminder",
        "content": "How it works: Reminds you of your track record during the panic attack.\n\nThe technique:\nTell yourself:\n• \"I have had ___ panic attacks in my life\"\n• \"I have survived 100% of them\"\n• \"This one will end too\"\n• \"The worst thing that happened was feeling terrible for 20 minutes\"\n• \"I know what to do. I've done this before.\"\n\nWhy it helps: Panic thrives on the idea that \"this time is different\" and something terrible will happen. Your history proves otherwise.\n\nMake it concrete: Keep a log of past attacks with timestamps showing when they ended."
