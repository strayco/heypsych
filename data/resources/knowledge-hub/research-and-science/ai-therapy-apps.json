        "heading": "What AI Therapy Apps Offer",
        "content": "Features: 24/7 availability, no wait times, lower cost ($10-60/month vs. $100-200/session), no judgment, CBT-based tools, mood tracking, crisis resources. Popular apps: Woebot, Wysa, Youper, Replika."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Benefits",
        "content": "AI excels at: Immediate support between therapy sessions. Teaching CBT skills and techniques. Mood tracking and pattern identification. Low-barrier entry for therapy-curious people. Supplementing human therapy. Reducing mild symptoms."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Limitations",
        "content": "AI cannot: Provide genuine empathy or human connection. Handle complex trauma or severe mental illness. Pick up on subtle non-verbal cues. Adapt to unexpected situations. Provide crisis intervention. Replace medication management. Understand context and nuance fully."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Privacy and Ethics Concerns",
        "content": "Issues: Data security (conversations may not be HIPAA-protected). AI bias in training data. Lack of accountability. Over-reliance preventing real treatment. Marketing to vulnerable populations. Unclear effectiveness data."
      },
      {
        "heading": "When AI Therapy Makes Sense",
        "content": "Good for: Mild anxiety or depression. Learning CBT skills. Between-session support. First step before traditional therapy. Supplement to human therapy. When human therapy is inaccessible. Not for: Severe mental illness, active suicidality, complex trauma, medication management."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Future of AI in Mental Health",
        "content": "Likely trajectory: AI as triage and screening tool. Chatbots for psychoeducation. Augmenting human therapists (not replacing). Personalized treatment recommendations. Early warning systems for relapse. But human connection will remain central to effective therapy."
      }
    ],
    "conclusion": "AI therapy apps are tools, not replacements for human therapists. They can be helpful for mild symptoms, skill-building, and accessibility, but they lack the empathy, nuance, and adaptability of human clinicians. The best approach may be blended: AI for support and skills, humans for complex care and connection."
