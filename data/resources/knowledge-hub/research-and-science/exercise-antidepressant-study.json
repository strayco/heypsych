        "heading": "What the Study Actually Found",
        "content": "The research: A 2024 meta-analysis published in the British Medical Journal reviewed over 200 randomized controlled trials comparing exercise interventions to control conditions for depression.\n\nKey findings:\n• Moderate to vigorous exercise showed effect sizes comparable to antidepressants and psychotherapy\n• Effect was dose-dependent: more exercise correlated with greater benefit\n• Benefits seen across age groups and severity levels\n• Walking, jogging, yoga, and strength training all showed benefits\n• Effect sizes were largest for walking/jogging, yoga, and strength training\n\nImportant context: This compared exercise to control conditions (no treatment or usual care), not head-to-head against medication in the same individuals. Most participants continued their existing treatments during the studies."

        "heading": "What the Headlines Got Wrong",
        "content": "Misleading claim: \"Just exercise instead of taking antidepressants\"\n\nReality:\n• Study wasn't designed to replace medication\n• Participants in exercise studies weren't necessarily on medication\n• Severely depressed people may lack energy to exercise without treatment first\n• Exercise + medication likely works better than either alone\n• This is about adding options, not replacing treatments"

        "heading": "How Exercise Helps Depression",
        "content": "Biological mechanisms:\n• Increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)\n• Reduces inflammation\n• Improves mitochondrial function\n• Releases endorphins and endocannabinoids\n• Regulates stress hormones\n\nPsychological factors:\n• Sense of accomplishment\n• Social connection (group exercise)\n• Structured routine\n• Distraction from rumination\n• Improved self-efficacy"

      {
        "heading": "Practical Recommendations",
        "content": "Effective dose: 150 minutes/week moderate intensity OR 75 minutes/week vigorous intensity\n\nWhat counts: Walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, strength training, yoga, dancing, sports\n\nGetting started when depressed:\n• Start small (5-10 minutes)\n• Any movement is better than none\n• Find something you don't hate\n• Exercise with others for accountability\n• Consider it part of treatment, not replacement"
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Bottom Line",
        "content": "Exercise is a powerful tool for depression that's free, has minimal side effects, and provides physical health benefits. But it's not a replacement for medication or therapy for moderate-to-severe depression.\n\nBest approach: Combine exercise, therapy, and medication as needed. Work with your healthcare provider to find the right combination for you."
      }
    ],
    "conclusion": "Exercise works for depression—the research is clear. But oversimplified headlines do a disservice by suggesting people should choose between exercise and evidence-based treatments. The real message: add movement to your mental health toolkit, whether or not you're also taking medication."
