        "content": "COMP360 Phase 2b Trial (2022): Single 25mg psilocybin dose with psychological support showed significant improvement in depression scores at 3 weeks. Approximately 30% of participants were in sustained remission at 12 weeks. This was the largest psilocybin trial for treatment-resistant depression to date.\n\nJohns Hopkins Study (2020): Published in JAMA Psychiatry, two psilocybin sessions with supportive psychotherapy showed rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. 71% of participants showed over 50% reduction in depression symptoms at 4-week follow-up.\n\nImperial College London (2021): Published in the New England Journal of Medicine, this head-to-head trial compared psilocybin therapy to escitalopram (an SSRI) for major depression. Both treatments showed similar effectiveness at 6 weeks, with psilocybin showing faster onset for some participants."

        "heading": "How Psilocybin May Work",
        "content": "Neuroplasticity: Psilocybin promotes growth of new neural connections, helping the brain \"reset\" rigid depression patterns.\n\nDefault Mode Network: Reduces overactivity in the DMN, disrupting rumination and negative thought patterns.\n\nPsychological insights: Many participants report profound experiences that shift their relationship to depression, trauma, and sense of self.\n\nSerotonin receptor activity: Activates 5-HT2A receptors, leading to increased neural plasticity and connectivity."

        "heading": "Important Caveats",
        "content": "This isn't recreational use: Clinical trials use:\n• Pharmaceutical-grade psilocybin\n• Careful medical screening\n• Preparation sessions\n• Trained therapist support during sessions\n• Integration therapy afterward\n\nNot for everyone: Contraindicated for people with psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar I, severe cardiovascular disease.\n\nLong-term data lacking: Most studies follow participants for 3-12 months. We don't know about effects beyond that.\n\nMechanism not fully understood: We don't know exactly why it works or who will respond best."

      {
        "heading": "Current Legal Status",
        "content": "Federal level: Psilocybin remains Schedule I (illegal).\n\nState level: Oregon and Colorado have legalized supervised therapeutic use. Several cities have decriminalized possession.\n\nClinical trials: Available through FDA-approved research studies in select locations.\n\nBreakthrough therapy designation: FDA granted this status in 2018, expediting research."

        "heading": "What This Means for Treatment-Resistant Depression",
        "content": "Hope for non-responders: 30-40% of people with depression don't respond adequately to conventional treatments. Psilocybin offers a new mechanism.\n\nRapid onset: Unlike SSRIs (4-6 weeks), psilocybin can show effects within days.\n\nDurability: Some people maintain benefits months after a single or few sessions.\n\nBut: It's not magic. It works best combined with therapy. Not everyone responds. We need more research."

      {
        "heading": "What Happens Next",
        "content": "FDA approval possible by 2025-2026 if current Phase 3 trials succeed.\n\nMore research needed on: Optimal dosing, frequency, who responds best, long-term safety, mechanisms.\n\nCurrent access: Clinical trials, compassionate use programs (limited), or legal supervised centers in Oregon/Colorado.\n\nFuture: Likely to be available through specialized clinics, not as take-home medication."

    ],
    "conclusion": "Psilocybin therapy represents genuine hope for treatment-resistant depression, with impressive results in clinical trials. But we're still in early stages. It's not a cure-all, it's not legal everywhere, and we need more long-term data. For people who've tried everything else, it's worth watching this space—and asking your doctor about clinical trial opportunities."
