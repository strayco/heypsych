    "description": "Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by significant impairment in the acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills. The difficulties are substantially below what is expected for the individual's age and level of intelligence and interfere with daily living, academic achievement, and leisure activities. DCD is not due to a medical condition affecting movement or intellectual disability.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills are substantially below that expected given chronological age and opportunity for skill learning. B. Motor skill deficits significantly and persistently interfere with activities of daily living, academic productivity, and/or leisure and play. C. Onset is in the early developmental period. D. Motor skill deficits are not better explained by intellectual disability, visual impairment, or neurological conditions affecting movement.",
    "prevalence": "Affects approximately 5–6% of school-aged children. More common in boys than girls.",
    "age_of_onset": "Symptoms typically present in early childhood when motor tasks become more complex and socially relevant.",
    "prognosis": "Motor difficulties often persist into adolescence and adulthood, though targeted intervention can improve skill acquisition and functional independence. Co-occurring conditions, such as ADHD or learning disorders, may affect outcomes.",
    "symptoms": {
      "motor_coordination_deficits": [

      "impact_examples": [
        "Takes much longer than peers to get dressed or tie shoelaces",
        "Avoids sports and playground activities due to motor challenges",

      "mild": "Motor skill challenges noticeable but manageable with accommodations; minimal impact on daily functioning.",

    "neurobiology": "Neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies suggest atypical development and connectivity in brain regions involved in motor planning, execution, and sensory integration, particularly the cerebellum, parietal lobes, and basal ganglia. Deficits in internal modeling, motor imagery, and predictive control are also implicated.",
