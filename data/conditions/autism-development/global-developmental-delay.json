    "description": "Global Developmental Delay (GDD) is a provisional diagnosis used for children under age 5 who show significant delays in two or more developmental domains (e.g., motor, language, cognitive, social/personal, activities of daily living) when the severity and full criteria for Intellectual Disability cannot yet be reliably assessed. Diagnosis should prompt comprehensive evaluation and early intervention, with reassessment over time.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "Significant delay (typically ≥2 standard deviations below mean or well below expected developmental milestones) in two or more domains (gross/fine motor, speech/language, cognition, social/personal, activities of daily living) in a child <5 years old. Not better accounted for by sensory loss alone (unmanaged hearing/vision), transient medical illness, or lack of opportunity. Requires ongoing monitoring and reassessment as the child matures.",
    "prevalence": "Varies by population and screening access; GDD is a descriptive label commonly used in early childhood clinics prior to a more specific etiologic diagnosis.",
    "age_of_onset": "Identified in infancy or early childhood when developmental milestones are not met on time.",
    "prognosis": "Outcomes depend on etiology, severity, and timing/intensity of intervention. Early, family-centered services (speech/OT/PT, special instruction) and addressing sensory/hearing/vision issues improve functional outcomes. Some children later meet criteria for Intellectual Disability; others catch up in specific domains.",
