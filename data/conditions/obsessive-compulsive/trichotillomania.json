    "description": "Trichotillomania is characterized by recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, with repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behavior. The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment and is not better explained by another medical or psychiatric condition.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Recurrent pulling out of hair, resulting in hair loss. B. Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling. C. The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., dermatological disease). E. The hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect in body dysmorphic disorder).",
    "prevalence": "Estimated 1–2% of the population; more common in females.",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically begins in early adolescence, though childhood onset is possible.",
    "prognosis": "Variable course; some have chronic symptoms, others experience episodic remission. Early treatment and behavioral strategies improve outcomes.",
