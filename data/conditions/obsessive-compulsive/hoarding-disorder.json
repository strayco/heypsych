    "description": "Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of actual value, due to a perceived need to save them and distress associated with discarding. The accumulation results in congested and cluttered living areas that compromise their intended use. Causes clinically significant distress or impairment and is not attributable to another medical condition or mental disorder.",

Not better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder.",
