    "description": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) due to another medical condition is characterized by prominent obsessions, compulsions, or both, that are a direct physiological consequence of another medical disorder. The symptoms cause significant distress, are time-consuming, or impair functioning, and are not better explained by another mental disorder.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Prominent obsessions, compulsions, or both. B. Evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition. C. Symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder. D. Symptoms do not occur exclusively during delirium. E. Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.",
    "prevalence": "Exact prevalence is unknown; depends on prevalence of associated medical conditions (e.g., Huntington's disease, epilepsy, brain injury).",
    "age_of_onset": "Varies according to onset of the underlying medical condition.",
