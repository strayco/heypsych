    "description": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are intrusive and unwanted, causing marked anxiety or distress. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules. These behaviors aim to reduce distress or prevent a feared event, but are excessive or not realistically connected to the event. The obsessions or compulsions cause significant distress, are time-consuming, or interfere with daily functioning.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both. B. Obsessions and/or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., >1 hour/day) or cause clinically significant distress/impairment. C. Symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. D. Disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.",
    "prevalence": "12-month prevalence about 1.2% in the U.S.; similar rates in males and females, though males have earlier onset.",
    "age_of_onset": "Bimodal onset — one peak in childhood/adolescence and another in early adulthood.",
    "prognosis": "Often chronic without treatment; early intervention improves outcomes. Many have waxing and waning symptoms. Good insight, lower baseline severity, and strong support are associated with better prognosis.",
