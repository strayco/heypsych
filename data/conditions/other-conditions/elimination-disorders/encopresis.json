    "description": "Encopresis is characterized by the repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., clothing, floor), whether involuntary or intentional, occurring at least once a month for at least three months. The behavior must occur in a child who is chronologically or developmentally older than 4 years. It may occur with or without constipation and overflow incontinence.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., clothing, floor), whether involuntary or intentional. B. At least one such event occurs each month for at least three months. C. Chronological age is at least 4 years (or equivalent developmental level). D. The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., laxatives) or another medical condition except through a mechanism involving constipation.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated at approximately 1% of 5-year-olds, with decreasing rates in older children. More common in males than females.",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically diagnosed after age 4; often develops between ages 5 and 7.",
    "prognosis": "With appropriate treatment, many children achieve full continence. Prognosis is better when constipation is addressed promptly and when behavioral interventions are consistent. Chronic constipation and untreated psychosocial stressors can prolong symptoms.",
