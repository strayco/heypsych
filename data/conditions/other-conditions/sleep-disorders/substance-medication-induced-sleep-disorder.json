    "description": "Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder involves prominent disturbances in sleep that are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a substance (including drugs of abuse, medications, toxins, or other chemicals). The sleep disturbance may present as insomnia, hypersomnolence, parasomnia, or a combination of these, and must be severe enough to cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. A prominent and severe disturbance in sleep. B. There is evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2): (1) The symptoms developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal, or after exposure to a medication. (2) The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the sleep disturbance. C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sleep disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.",
    "prevalence": "Prevalence varies depending on population and substance type; more common among individuals using stimulants, sedatives, alcohol, or certain prescription medications.",
    "age_of_onset": "Can occur at any age depending on timing of substance exposure.",
    "prognosis": "Typically resolves after cessation of the substance or medication, though chronic sleep problems may persist in some individuals, especially with prolonged or repeated exposure.",
