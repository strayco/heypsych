    "description": "Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) involves one or more distressing physical symptoms that are accompanied by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to those symptoms. The symptoms may or may not have a medical explanation, but the distress and impairment they cause are disproportionate to any underlying medical condition.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life. B. Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns as manifested by at least one of the following: (1) Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one's symptoms. (2) Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms. (3) Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns. C. Although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the state of being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months).",

    "age_of_onset": "Can begin at any age, but often emerges in adolescence or early adulthood.",
