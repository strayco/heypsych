    "description": "Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions is diagnosed when psychological or behavioral factors adversely influence the course or treatment of a medical condition. These factors may exacerbate symptoms, interfere with treatment adherence, contribute to the onset of the condition, or increase health risks.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. A medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is present. B. Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition in one of the following ways: (1) Influence the course of the medical condition as shown by a temporal association between the psychological factors and the development, exacerbation, or delayed recovery from the medical condition. (2) Interfere with the treatment of the medical condition. (3) Constitute additional well-established health risks for the individual.

The psychological and behavioral factors are not better explained by another mental disorder.",
