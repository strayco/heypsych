    "description": "Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states or identities, which may be experienced as distinct selves or as an alteration in sense of self. These states are accompanied by recurrent gaps in recall of everyday events, personal information, and/or traumatic events, inconsistent with ordinary forgetting. The condition is closely linked to severe, chronic trauma, often beginning in early childhood.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states, which may be described in some cultures as possession. B. Recurrent gaps in recall of everyday events, important personal information, and/or traumatic events inconsistent with ordinary forgetting. C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice. E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated prevalence in the general population is about 1–1.5%, higher in clinical populations, especially those with histories of severe trauma.",
    "age_of_onset": "Symptoms typically begin in early childhood, but diagnosis often occurs in adulthood.",
    "prognosis": "Chronic course without treatment, but with appropriate trauma-focused therapy, individuals may achieve improved integration, symptom reduction, and functioning. Early intervention, strong therapeutic alliance, and stable environment improve prognosis.",
