    "description": "Transvestic Disorder is characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors, causing clinically significant distress or impairment. The arousal may be related to the clothing itself or to the act of cross-dressing. This diagnosis is distinct from cross-dressing as part of gender expression or identity, which is not considered a disorder unless it is associated with distress or impairment.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Over a period of ≥6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. B. The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. C. In men, may occur with or without autogynephilia (arousal at the thought or image of oneself as a female).",
    "prevalence": "Exact prevalence is unknown. More commonly reported in men; onset often in adolescence with gradual development.",
    "age_of_onset": "Usually begins in childhood or adolescence with interest in cross-dressing, sometimes linked to early sexual experiences.",
    "prognosis": "Many individuals learn to manage behaviors in ways that reduce distress. Prognosis improves when treatment addresses comorbid conditions such as anxiety or depression. Without distress or impairment, the behavior is not pathological.",
