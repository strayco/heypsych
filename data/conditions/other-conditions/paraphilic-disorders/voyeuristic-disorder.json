    "description": "Voyeuristic Disorder is characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity. This arousal manifests in fantasies, urges, or behaviors over a period of at least 6 months, and the individual has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person, or the urges cause clinically significant distress or impairment. It is distinct from consensual voyeurism (e.g., mutual sexual viewing) which is not pathological.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Over a period of ≥6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. B. The individual has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person, or the urges/fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment. C. The individual experiencing the arousal is at least 18 years of age.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated prevalence is unknown in the general population; higher rates are found among individuals arrested for sexual offenses. More common in men than women.",
