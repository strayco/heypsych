    "description": "Exhibitionistic Disorder is characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the exposure of one’s genitals to an unsuspecting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors, occurring over a period of at least six months. The individual has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person, or the urges/fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Over a period of at least six months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the exposure of one’s genitals to an unsuspecting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. B. The individual has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges/fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment. C. The individual is at least 18 years of age.",
    "prevalence": "Exact prevalence is unknown; reported rates vary. Exhibitionistic behaviors are more often reported in men, though the disorder may occur in any gender.",
    "age_of_onset": "Onset is typically in late adolescence to early adulthood, though behaviors may begin earlier and escalate over time.",
    "prognosis": "Without treatment, behaviors may persist or escalate, especially if reinforced by sexual gratification or lack of consequences. Engagement in treatment, especially cognitive-behavioral and relapse-prevention approaches, can reduce risk of recurrence. Chronic course possible if untreated.",
