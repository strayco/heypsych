    "description": "Pedophilic Disorder is characterized by recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with prepubescent children (generally age 13 or younger). The individual is at least 16 years old and at least 5 years older than the child(ren). Diagnosis requires that the person has acted on these urges or the urges/fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. The diagnosis applies to the disorder, not merely the presence of sexual attraction, and distinguishes between pedophilic sexual interest and pedophilic disorder with behavioral or distress criteria met.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Over a period of ≥6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger). B. The individual has acted on these urges, or the urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. C. The individual is at least age 16 years and at least 5 years older than the child or children. Note: This diagnosis should not be applied to an individual in late adolescence involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with a 12- or 13-year-old.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated prevalence is unknown due to underreporting; more common in men. Research suggests a minority of individuals with pedophilic sexual interest meet full disorder criteria.",
    "age_of_onset": "Pedophilic sexual interest typically emerges in mid-to-late adolescence, though recognition of persistent attraction may occur later. Behaviors may begin in adolescence or adulthood.",
    "prognosis": "Pedophilic sexual interest is generally stable over time, but acting on urges can be reduced through specialized treatment, supervision, and, in some cases, pharmacological intervention. Risk of recidivism is highest without treatment or supervision.",
