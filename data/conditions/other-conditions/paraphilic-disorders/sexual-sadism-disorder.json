    "description": "Sexual Sadism Disorder is characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the physical or psychological suffering of another person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. The diagnosis requires that the individual has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person, or that the fantasies, urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Consensual sadomasochistic activities are not considered a disorder unless they cause distress, impairment, or involve nonconsensual acts.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Over a period of ≥6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the physical or psychological suffering of another person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. B. The individual has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person, or the fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment. C. The arousal may be to inflicting physical pain, humiliation, or fear.",
    "prevalence": "Exact prevalence is unknown; sexual sadistic fantasies are present in a subset of the general population, but the disorder is rare. More commonly diagnosed in men, particularly in forensic populations.",
    "age_of_onset": "Fantasies or urges may emerge in adolescence; behaviors may occur in late adolescence or early adulthood.",
    "prognosis": "Prognosis is variable. Individuals with the disorder who engage in nonconsensual acts are at high risk for legal consequences and interpersonal harm. Treatment can reduce risk of offending and improve control over urges, especially with early intervention.",
