    "description": "Fetishistic Disorder is characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from either the use of nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on nongenital body parts, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. The fetish objects are not limited to articles of clothing used in cross-dressing or devices specifically designed for tactile genital stimulation. Diagnosis requires that the condition cause clinically significant distress or impairment, or involve nonconsenting individuals.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Over a period of at least six months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from either the use of nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on nongenital body parts, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. B. The fantasies, urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. C. The fetish objects are not limited to articles of clothing used in cross-dressing or devices specifically designed for sexual stimulation.",
    "prevalence": "Exact prevalence is unknown; more common in men, with onset typically during adolescence. Mild fetishistic interests are relatively common, but diagnosis is reserved for cases causing significant distress or impairment.",
    "age_of_onset": "Usually begins in adolescence, coinciding with sexual development. May be preceded by nonsexual fascination with objects or body parts in childhood.",
    "prognosis": "Fetishistic interests tend to be lifelong, though the intensity can fluctuate. Prognosis is favorable when the fetish is integrated into consensual sexual activity without harm; problematic patterns may persist without treatment.",
