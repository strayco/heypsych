    "description": "Sexual Masochism Disorder is characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer. The fantasies, urges, or behaviors must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, or involve harm or risk of harm to self or others. Consensual sexual masochistic activities that do not cause distress or impairment are not considered a disorder.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Over a period of ≥6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. B. The individual has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person, or the fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment. C. Specify if: With asphyxiophilia (sexual arousal by restriction of breathing).",
    "prevalence": "Exact prevalence is unknown; masochistic fantasies are relatively common in the general population, but the disorder is rare. More frequently diagnosed in men.",
    "age_of_onset": "Fantasies may begin in adolescence; behaviors may emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood.",
    "prognosis": "When consensual and safe, sexual masochistic behaviors may remain stable and non-problematic. In cases meeting disorder criteria, distress and functional impairment can be reduced with psychotherapy. Risk of accidental injury or death is higher in asphyxiophilia.",
