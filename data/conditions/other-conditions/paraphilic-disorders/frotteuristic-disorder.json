    "description": "Frotteuristic Disorder is characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors, occurring for at least six months. Diagnosis requires the individual has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person, or the urges/fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. For ≥6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges/fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment. C. Typically diagnosed in individuals ≥18 years old (consider developmental context).",
    "prevalence": "Exact prevalence is unknown; behaviors are reported predominantly in males. Offenses often occur in crowded public spaces (e.g., buses, trains, clubs).",
    "age_of_onset": "Usually emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood; may follow a period of voyeurism or exhibitionism in some individuals.",
    "prognosis": "Without treatment, behaviors can persist or escalate, particularly when reinforced by sexual gratification and anonymity. Engagement in structured treatment (CBT, relapse prevention, and where indicated pharmacotherapy) reduces recidivism. Risk fluctuates with stress, substance use, and opportunity.",
