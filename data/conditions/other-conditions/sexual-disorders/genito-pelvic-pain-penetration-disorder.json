    "description": "Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPPD) is characterized by persistent or recurrent difficulties with one or more of the following: vaginal penetration during intercourse; marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during penetration attempts or intercourse; fear or anxiety about pain before, during, or as a result of penetration; and marked tensing or tightening of pelvic floor muscles during attempted penetration. The condition combines features previously classified separately as dyspareunia and vaginismus.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Persistent or recurrent difficulties with one or more of the following: 1) Vaginal penetration during intercourse; 2) Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts; 3) Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of penetration; 4) Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration. B. The symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months. C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress. D. The disturbance is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, severe relationship distress, or other stressors, and is not attributable to a substance/medication or another medical condition.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated to affect 10–20% of women at some point in their lives; persistent, distressing forms are less common.",
    "age_of_onset": "Can occur at any age after sexual debut; often emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood.",
    "prognosis": "Many women improve with appropriate treatment including pelvic floor physical therapy, sex therapy, and gradual desensitization. Chronic untreated cases may lead to avoidance of sexual activity and relationship strain.",
