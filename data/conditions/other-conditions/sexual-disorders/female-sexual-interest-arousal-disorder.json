    "description": "Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (FSIAD) is characterized by a lack or significant reduction in sexual interest and/or arousal in most or all sexual situations. It encompasses both the desire and arousal components of sexual functioning in women, which are often intertwined.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual interest/arousal, as manifested by at least three of the following: 1) Absent/reduced interest in sexual activity; 2) Absent/reduced sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies; 3) No/reduced initiation of sexual activity and typically unreceptive to a partner's attempts to initiate; 4) Absent/reduced sexual excitement/pleasure during sexual activity in almost all (75–100%) sexual encounters; 5) Absent/reduced sexual interest/arousal in response to any internal or external sexual/erotic cues; 6) Absent/reduced genital or nongenital sensations during sexual activity in almost all sexual encounters. B. Symptoms have persisted for a minimum of 6 months. C. Symptoms cause clinically significant distress. D. The dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, severe relationship distress, or other stressors, and is not attributable to a substance/medication or another medical condition.",
