    "description": "Premature Ejaculation (PE) is characterized by ejaculation that always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about one minute of vaginal penetration (or before the individual wishes it in other sexual contexts), accompanied by an inability to delay ejaculation and negative personal consequences such as distress, frustration, or avoidance of intimacy.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Ejaculation during partnered sexual activity within approximately 1 minute following vaginal penetration and before the individual wishes it. For non-vaginal sexual activities, comparable timing and control issues may apply. B. The symptom has been present for at least 6 months and on almost all or all occasions of sexual activity. C. The condition causes clinically significant distress. D. The dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, the effects of a substance/medication, or another medical condition.",
    "prevalence": "Lifelong PE affects approximately 1–3% of men; acquired PE is more common and may affect 4–5% or more.",
    "age_of_onset": "Lifelong type usually begins with the onset of sexual activity; acquired type can occur at any age.",
    "prognosis": "With appropriate treatment, many individuals achieve improved ejaculatory control and reduced distress. Lifelong PE often requires ongoing management; acquired PE may resolve if underlying causes are addressed.",

        "Brainstem centers (e.g., medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus) integrate sensory input and initiate ejaculation via spinal reflexes.",
