    "description": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) is characterized by a marked, persistent fear or anxiety about one or more social situations where the individual may be scrutinized by others. The person fears acting in a way, or showing anxiety symptoms, that will be negatively evaluated (e.g., humiliation, embarrassment, rejection). These social situations almost always provoke fear/anxiety, are avoided or endured with intense distress, and cause significant functional impairment. Duration is typically ≥6 months.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Marked fear/anxiety about ≥1 social situations involving possible scrutiny. B. Fear of negative evaluation. C. Social situations almost always provoke fear/anxiety. D. Avoidance or endured with intense fear/anxiety. E. Disproportionate to actual threat. F. Persistent (≥6 months). G. Causes distress/impairment. H. Not attributable to a substance/medical condition. I. Not better explained by another mental disorder. J. If another medical condition is present, fear is unrelated or excessive.",
