    "description": "Specific Phobia is characterized by marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood). The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety, is actively avoided or endured with intense distress, and the fear is out of proportion to the actual danger posed. Duration is typically at least 6 months and causes clinically significant distress or impairment.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. B. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety. C. Actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. D. Fear or anxiety is out of proportion to actual danger and sociocultural context. E. Persistent, typically ≥6 months. F. Causes clinically significant distress or impairment. G. Not better explained by another mental disorder.",
    "prevalence": "12-month prevalence in U.S. adults ~7–9%; more common in females; prevalence higher in children (up to ~15%) but declines in older adults.",
    "age_of_onset": "Median onset around 7–10 years old; many cases begin in childhood following a traumatic or aversive event.",
