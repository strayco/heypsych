    "description": "Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder is characterized by the presence of either motor tics or vocal tics (but not both) for more than 1 year since first tic onset, with onset before age 18, not attributable to a substance or another medical condition, and criteria not met for Tourette’s Disorder.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Single or multiple motor tics or vocal tics have been present during the illness, but not both. B. The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for >1 year since first tic onset. C. Onset before age 18. D. Disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. E. Criteria have never been met for Tourette’s Disorder.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated ~1–2% of children; many experience peak severity between ages 9–12 with gradual improvement in adolescence.",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically 4–8 years; course waxes and wanes with stress, excitement, and fatigue.",
    "prognosis": "Many individuals improve in late adolescence/early adulthood. Functional impact depends on tic frequency/severity, visibility, and comorbid conditions (e.g., ADHD, OCD). Behavioral therapy (CBIT) and, when necessary, targeted medications reduce impairment.",
