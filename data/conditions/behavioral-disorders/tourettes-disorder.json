    "description": "Tourette’s Disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic that have been present for more than one year, with onset before age 18. Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic movements or vocalizations that can change over time in type, frequency, and severity.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Both multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics have been present at some time during the illness, though not necessarily concurrently. B. Tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than one year since first tic onset. C. Onset is before age 18. D. Not attributable to substance use or another medical condition.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated at 0.3–0.8% of school-age children; males are affected more often than females (3–4:1).",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically between ages 4 and 6 for motor tics; vocal tics often appear a few years later.",
    "prognosis": "Tics often peak in severity between ages 10 and 12 and improve in late adolescence; some individuals continue to experience tics into adulthood. Co-occurring ADHD, OCD, or mood disorders can influence long-term outcomes.",
