    "description": "Provisional Tic Disorder is characterized by the presence of single or multiple motor and/or vocal tics that have been present for less than 1 year since first tic onset, with onset before age 18, and not better explained by another medical or psychiatric condition. It is often a self-limited condition, particularly in childhood.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Single or multiple motor and/or vocal tics. B. Tics have been present for less than 12 months since onset. C. Onset before age 18. D. Disturbance not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. E. Criteria have never been met for Tourette’s Disorder or Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder.",
    "prevalence": "Up to 10–20% of school-aged children experience transient tics, but most remit within a year. Provisional Tic Disorder is more common in males.",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically 4–8 years, often after an illness, stressor, or without clear precipitant.",
    "prognosis": "Many cases resolve within months. A minority progress to Persistent Tic Disorders or Tourette’s Disorder, especially if tics persist beyond 6–12 months or if there is a family history of tics/OCD.",
