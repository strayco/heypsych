    "description": "Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is characterized by a recurrent pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months, exhibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling. Behaviors are beyond normative childhood misbehavior for developmental level and cause significant distress or functional impairment.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months, with at least four symptoms from any of the categories, exhibited during interaction with at least one non-sibling: Angry/Irritable Mood (loses temper, touchy/easily annoyed, angry/resentful); Argumentative/Defiant Behavior (argues with authority figures/adults, actively defies/refuses to comply with requests or rules, deliberately annoys others, blames others for mistakes/misbehavior); Vindictiveness (spiteful or vindictive at least twice in past 6 months). B. Disturbance is associated with distress or functional impairment. C. Behaviors do not occur exclusively during psychotic, substance use, depressive, or bipolar disorders, and criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are not met.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated 1–11% in children/adolescents, more common in males before adolescence; prevalence equalizes after puberty.",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically emerges in preschool years; rarely after early adolescence.",
    "prognosis": "ODD may remit, persist, or evolve into Conduct Disorder or other behavioral disorders if untreated. Early, consistent intervention and strong caregiver–child relationships improve outcomes.",
