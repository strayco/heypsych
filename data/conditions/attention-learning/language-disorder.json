    "description": "Language Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across modalities (spoken, written, sign) due to deficits in comprehension and/or production. Areas affected often include vocabulary, sentence structure/grammar, and discourse. Difficulties are substantially below age expectations, begin in the early developmental period, and result in functional impairment. Deficits are not attributable to hearing loss, motor speech disorder, intellectual disability, neurological or medical conditions, or lack of exposure.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Persistent difficulties in language acquisition and use across modalities due to deficits in comprehension or production (e.g., reduced vocabulary, limited sentence structure, impairments in discourse). B. Language abilities substantially below those expected for age, resulting in functional limitations. C. Onset in the early developmental period. D. Not attributable to hearing or other sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, neurological conditions, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, or lack of language exposure.",
    "evaluation": {
      "clinical_interview": "Developmental history, early milestones, language exposure(s), family history of speech/language disorders, functional impact at home/school.",
      "speech_language_pathology": [
