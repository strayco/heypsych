    "description": "Speech Sound Disorder (SSD) is characterized by persistent difficulties with speech sound production that interfere with speech intelligibility or prevent verbal communication of messages. Errors exceed what is expected for age or developmental level, cause functional impairment, and are not attributable to congenital or acquired conditions (e.g., hearing loss, structural anomalies, neurological disorders).",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "Persistent difficulty with speech sound production resulting in inaccurate articulation, phonological pattern errors, or reduced intelligibility; disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that interfere with social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance; onset in early developmental period; not attributable to congenital/acquired conditions, neurological disorder, hearing loss, or other medical condition.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated 3–5% of preschool and early school-age children; more common in males.",
    "age_of_onset": "Symptoms typically evident by ages 3–4 when speech should be increasingly intelligible to unfamiliar listeners.",
    "prognosis": "Many children improve with targeted speech-language therapy; residual errors can persist into adolescence without intervention, especially for later-developing sounds or complex phonological processes.",
