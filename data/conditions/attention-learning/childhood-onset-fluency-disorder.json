    "description": "Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder, commonly known as stuttering, is characterized by disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that are inappropriate for the individual's age and language skills, persist over time, and cause anxiety about speaking or limitations in communication. It typically involves sound or syllable repetitions, prolongations, broken words, blocking, circumlocutions, or monosyllabic whole-word repetitions.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech (e.g., sound/syllable repetitions, prolongations, broken words, blocking, circumlocutions, monosyllabic whole-word repetitions) inappropriate for the individual's age and language skills, and persistent over time. B. Disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in effective communication, social participation, or academic/occupational performance. C. Onset in early developmental period. D. Not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory deficit, dysfluency associated with neurological insult, or another medical condition, and not better explained by another mental disorder.",
    "evaluation": {
      "clinical_interview": "Obtain detailed history of speech development, onset of dysfluency, course over time, and impact on communication and social functioning.",
      "speech_language_assessment": "Formal evaluation by a speech-language pathologist using standardized fluency measures and language assessment tools.",
      "observation": "Direct observation of speech in multiple contexts (structured tasks, spontaneous conversation, varying stress levels).",
      "collateral_information": "Gather input from parents, caregivers, or teachers to document onset, pattern, and triggers of dysfluency.",
      "rule_outs": "Exclude speech dysfluency due to hearing loss, oral-motor deficits, neurological injury, intellectual disability, or other language disorders.",
      "functional_assessment": "Evaluate impact on academic performance, peer relationships, and participation in social activities.",
      "duration_and_pervasiveness": "Confirm persistence beyond normal developmental stuttering phase and presence across different settings.",
      "cultural_considerations": "Consider cultural norms and language differences in speech rhythm, pacing, and communication style."
    },
    "prevalence": "Estimated 5% of children experience stuttering at some point, with approximately 1% persisting into adulthood. More common in males than females (ratio about 2–4:1).",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically begins between ages 2 and 7, most often before age 6.",
    "prognosis": "Many children experience spontaneous recovery, especially with early intervention. Persistent cases may continue into adolescence or adulthood, but speech therapy can significantly reduce severity and improve communication confidence.",
    "symptoms": [
      "Sound or syllable repetitions",
      "Prolongation of consonants or vowels",
      "Blocking (audible or silent pauses in speech)",
      "Broken words or abnormal pauses within words",
      "Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions",
      "Substitutions or circumlocutions to avoid problem words",
      "Visible tension in face or neck during speech",
      "Avoidance of speaking situations due to fear of stuttering"

    "severity_levels": {
      "mild": "Occasional speech disruptions without significant avoidance or anxiety.",
      "moderate": "Frequent dysfluencies with noticeable tension or avoidance of certain words/situations.",
