    "description": "A childhood condition characterized by severe, recurrent temper outbursts (verbal or behavioral) that are grossly out of proportion to the situation, along with persistently irritable or angry mood between outbursts. Symptoms are present for at least 12 months, occur in multiple settings, and are inconsistent with developmental level.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g., verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward people or property) grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation. B. Outbursts inconsistent with developmental level. C. Occur on average three or more times per week. D. Mood between outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day. E. Criteria present for 12+ months without symptom-free period >3 months. F. Present in at least two settings and severe in at least one. G. Onset before age 10; diagnosis not made before age 6 or after age 18. H. Symptoms not exclusively during major depressive episode and not better explained by another disorder (e.g., autism, PTSD, separation anxiety, persistent depressive disorder). I. Not attributable to substance/medical condition.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated 2–5% of children and adolescents; more common in males and school-aged populations.",
    "age_of_onset": "Before age 10, diagnosis typically made in school-age children or early adolescence.",
    "prognosis": "High risk for later unipolar depression and anxiety disorders rather than bipolar disorder. Symptoms may lessen with age, but irritability and mood dysregulation can persist. Functional impairment in academic, social, and family domains is common.",
