    "description": "Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) involves the re-experiencing of perceptual disturbances that were experienced during hallucinogen intoxication, even after the substance has been eliminated from the body. These symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment and are not due to another medical condition or mental disorder.",
    "neurobiology": {
      "mechanisms": [
        "Persistent changes in cortical visual processing pathways, particularly occipital cortex hyperexcitability.",
        "Alterations in serotonergic neurotransmission (5-HT2A receptor activity) due to hallucinogen exposure.",
        "Disruption of sensory gating mechanisms in thalamocortical circuits."
      ]
    },
    "diagnostic_criteria": "Following cessation of hallucinogen use, the person re-experiences one or more perceptual symptoms that were experienced while intoxicated with the hallucinogen (e.g., geometric hallucinations, false perceptions of movement, flashes of color, afterimages, halos around objects, size distortions). Symptoms cause distress or impairment, are not attributable to another medical condition, and are not better explained by another mental disorder.",
    "prevalence": "Exact prevalence is unknown; estimated to be rare, but underreported due to stigma or misattribution to other conditions.",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically occurs in late adolescence to young adulthood, corresponding to peak hallucinogen use.",
    "prognosis": "Varies; some experience spontaneous remission over months to years, while others have persistent symptoms. Prognosis is better with abstinence and treatment of comorbid anxiety.",
