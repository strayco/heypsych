    "description": "Cannabis-related disorders include Cannabis Use Disorder, Cannabis Intoxication, and Cannabis Withdrawal. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit psychoactive substance, with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as its main psychoactive component. Use can lead to acute cognitive and perceptual changes, functional impairment, and in some individuals, dependence and withdrawal symptoms.",
    "neurobiology": {
      "mechanisms": [
        "THC binds to cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the central nervous system, modulating release of neurotransmitters such as GABA, glutamate, and dopamine.",
        "Activation of CB1 receptors in brain areas including the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum affects memory, executive function, coordination, and reward processing.",
        "Chronic exposure can downregulate CB1 receptor density and alter endocannabinoid signaling, contributing to tolerance and withdrawal."
      ]
    },
    "diagnostic_criteria": {
      "use_disorder": "A problematic pattern of cannabis use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, manifested by ≥2 of the following within a 12-month period: use in larger amounts or over longer periods than intended; persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down; excessive time spent obtaining/using/recovering; craving; recurrent use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations; continued use despite social/interpersonal problems; giving up activities; use in physically hazardous situations; continued use despite physical/psychological problems; tolerance; withdrawal.",
      "intoxication": "Recent cannabis use with clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., impaired coordination, euphoria, anxiety, sensation of slowed time, impaired judgment, social withdrawal) plus ≥2 signs developing within 2 hours of use: conjunctival injection, increased appetite, dry mouth, tachycardia.",
      "withdrawal": "Cessation of heavy/prolonged cannabis use, with ≥3 symptoms developing within about 1 week: irritability/anger/aggression, nervousness/anxiety, sleep difficulty, decreased appetite/weight loss, restlessness, depressed mood, plus ≥1 physical symptom (abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors, sweating, fever, chills, headache). Symptoms cause distress/impairment."
    },
    "prevalence": "Cannabis use disorder affects ~4% of U.S. adults; prevalence is highest among young adults (18–25). Withdrawal is reported in ~50% of daily users who quit abruptly.",
    "age_of_onset": "Often begins in adolescence, with earlier onset associated with higher risk of dependence and cognitive effects.",
    "prognosis": "Many remit with sustained abstinence, though relapse rates are high in the first 6–12 months. Earlier onset, heavy use, and comorbid psychiatric disorders predict poorer outcomes.",
