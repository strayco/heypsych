    "description": "Opioids are a class of drugs that include prescription pain relievers (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine), synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl), and illegal drugs (e.g., heroin). Opioid Use Disorder is a problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. Intoxication involves recent opioid use resulting in characteristic behavioral and physical signs, while withdrawal is a predictable syndrome that occurs after stopping or reducing prolonged use.",
    "neurobiology": {
      "mechanisms": [
        "Opioids bind to mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors, producing analgesia, euphoria, and respiratory depression.",
        "Increased dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway contributes to reinforcing effects.",
        "Chronic exposure leads to neuroadaptations in the locus coeruleus and periaqueductal gray, contributing to tolerance and withdrawal."

    "diagnostic_criteria": {
      "use_disorder": "At least 2 of 11 DSM-5 criteria within 12 months (e.g., taking larger amounts, unsuccessful efforts to cut down, craving, role impairment, continued use despite harm, tolerance, withdrawal).",
      "intoxication": "Recent opioid use, clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., initial euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria, impaired judgment), and pupillary constriction plus at least one of: drowsiness or coma, slurred speech, impairment in attention or memory.",
      "withdrawal": "Either cessation/reduction in heavy and prolonged opioid use or administration of an opioid antagonist after such use, plus at least three of: dysphoric mood, nausea/vomiting, muscle aches, lacrimation/rhinorrhea, pupillary dilation/piloerection/sweating, diarrhea, yawning, fever, insomnia."
    },
    "prevalence": "Approximately 2.1 million people in the U.S. have an opioid use disorder; highest prevalence among young adults but affects all age groups.",
    "age_of_onset": "Often begins with prescription opioids in late adolescence or early adulthood, though onset can occur at any age.",
    "prognosis": "Chronic relapsing course without treatment; high risk of overdose and death, particularly with fentanyl-contaminated supply; long-term recovery possible with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and psychosocial support.",
