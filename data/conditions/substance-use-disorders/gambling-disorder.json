        "Heightened sensitivity to reward cues and diminished sensitivity to losses."
      ]
    },
    "diagnostic_criteria": "Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior, as indicated by ≥4 of the following in a 12-month period: needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money to achieve excitement; restless/irritable when attempting to cut down; repeated unsuccessful efforts to control/cut back/stop; preoccupied with gambling; gambles when distressed; after losing money, returns to get even; lies to conceal extent; jeopardized/ lost relationships, job, or education; relies on others for money to relieve financial situation.
