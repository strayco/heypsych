    "description": "Alcohol-related disorders encompass a spectrum including Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), Alcohol Intoxication, and Alcohol Withdrawal. Alcohol is a CNS depressant with widespread social use but significant potential for misuse, dependence, and medical complications.",
    "neurobiology": {
      "mechanisms": [
        "Potentiation of GABA-A receptor activity leading to CNS depression and anxiolysis.",
        "Inhibition of NMDA glutamate receptors contributing to cognitive/motor impairment.",
        "Mesolimbic dopamine release reinforcing reward and addictive behaviors.",

    "diagnostic_criteria": {
      "use_disorder": "A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment/distress, manifested by ≥2 criteria within a 12-month period (e.g., tolerance, withdrawal, craving, loss of control, continued use despite harm).",
      "intoxication": "Recent ingestion of alcohol with clinically significant maladaptive behavior or psychological changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual/aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment) plus ≥1: slurred speech, incoordination, unsteady gait, nystagmus, impaired attention/memory, stupor/coma. Not due to another condition.",
      "withdrawal": "Cessation/reduction after heavy prolonged use, with ≥2 within hours–days: autonomic hyperactivity, hand tremor, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, hallucinations, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, seizures. Not due to another condition."
    },
    "prevalence": "AUD affects ~5–6% of U.S. adults annually; prevalence higher among men and younger adults; global burden varies widely.",
    "age_of_onset": "Commonly begins in late adolescence or early adulthood; severe AUD may develop after years of heavy use.",
    "prognosis": "With treatment and sustained abstinence, prognosis is favorable; without treatment, course is often chronic-relapsing with risk of cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and death.",
