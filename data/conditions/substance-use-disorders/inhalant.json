    "description": "Inhalants are volatile substances that produce chemical vapors, which can be inhaled to induce psychoactive or mind-altering effects. Inhalant Use Disorder involves a problematic pattern of inhalant use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. Intoxication occurs rapidly after inhalation, often producing short-lived effects but carrying serious medical risks.",
    "neurobiology": {
      "mechanisms": [
        "Rapid absorption of volatile chemicals through the lungs into the bloodstream, leading to CNS depression.",
        "Potentiation of GABA-A receptor activity and inhibition of NMDA glutamate receptors.",
        "Disruption of dopamine transmission in mesolimbic pathways, producing euphoria."

    },
    "diagnostic_criteria": {
      "use_disorder": "Problematic pattern of inhalant use leading to impairment/distress, with at least 2 of 11 criteria over 12 months (e.g., larger amounts over time, unsuccessful cut-down attempts, craving, role impairment, hazardous use, tolerance, withdrawal — although withdrawal is not well established).",
      "intoxication": "Recent intentional use or exposure to inhalants, clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., belligerence, apathy, impaired judgment) developing during or shortly after use, and at least 2 signs (dizziness, nystagmus, incoordination, slurred speech, unsteady gait, lethargy, depressed reflexes, tremor, blurred vision, stupor or coma, euphoria)."
    },
    "prevalence": "More common in adolescents; lifetime prevalence ~0.4% in U.S. adults, but higher in certain marginalized populations.",
    "age_of_onset": "Often begins in early adolescence due to ease of access and low cost.",
    "prognosis": "Prognosis is variable; early initiation linked to higher risk of neurocognitive impairment, sudden sniffing death, and transition to other substance use disorders. Sustained abstinence is possible with early intervention.",
