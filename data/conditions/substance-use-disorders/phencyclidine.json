    "description": "Phencyclidine (PCP) is a dissociative hallucinogen that was originally developed as an anesthetic. It produces a unique combination of stimulant, depressant, hallucinogenic, and dissociative effects. Use disorder involves a problematic pattern of PCP use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, while intoxication refers to recent use with characteristic behavioral and physical symptoms.",
    "neurobiology": {
      "mechanisms": [
        "PCP is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, disrupting glutamate neurotransmission and causing dissociation.",
        "It also influences dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin systems, contributing to psychosis-like symptoms and mood alterations.",
        "High doses can affect multiple neurotransmitter systems, leading to severe agitation, delirium, and potential neurotoxicity."
      ]

      "use_disorder": "At least 2 of 11 DSM-5 criteria within 12 months (e.g., taking larger amounts, unsuccessful efforts to cut down, craving, role impairment, continued use despite harm, tolerance).",
      "intoxication": "Recent PCP use, clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., belligerence, assaultiveness, impulsiveness, unpredictability, psychomotor agitation), plus at least two of: vertical or horizontal nystagmus, hypertension or tachycardia, numbness or decreased responsiveness to pain, ataxia, dysarthria, muscle rigidity, seizures or coma, hyperacusis."
    },
    "prevalence": "Relatively uncommon compared to other substances; use is concentrated in certain regions and subcultures.",
    "age_of_onset": "Most often in adolescence or early adulthood.",
    "prognosis": "PCP intoxication can be life-threatening due to violent behavior, accidents, or severe medical complications; chronic use can cause persistent cognitive and mood disturbances.",
