    "description": "Caffeine-related disorders include Caffeine Intoxication and Caffeine Withdrawal. Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance globally, acting as a central nervous system stimulant. While generally safe in moderate doses, excessive or abrupt changes in intake can cause clinically significant symptoms.",
    "neurobiology": {
      "mechanisms": [
        "Adenosine receptor antagonism (A1 and A2A), reducing inhibitory neurotransmission and promoting wakefulness.",
        "Increased dopamine and norepinephrine release contributing to alertness, mood elevation, and potential for dependence.",
        "Stimulation of autonomic nervous system leading to cardiovascular and gastrointestinal effects."
      ]
    },
    "diagnostic_criteria": {
      "intoxication": "Recent caffeine consumption (>250 mg, though sensitive individuals may react to less) with ≥5 symptoms developing during or shortly after use: restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, diuresis, GI disturbance, muscle twitching, rambling speech, tachycardia or arrhythmia, periods of inexhaustibility, psychomotor agitation. Symptoms cause distress/impairment and are not due to another condition.",
      "withdrawal": "Prolonged daily caffeine use followed by abrupt cessation/reduction, with ≥3 symptoms within 24 hours: headache, marked fatigue/drowsiness, dysphoric/depressed mood, irritability, difficulty concentrating, flu-like symptoms (nausea, muscle pain). Symptoms cause distress/impairment and are not due to another condition."
    },
    "prevalence": "Caffeine is consumed by ~85% of adults in the U.S. daily; withdrawal occurs in habitual users who abruptly stop, prevalence unknown but common in heavy users.",
    "age_of_onset": "Caffeine use often begins in childhood/adolescence (soft drinks, tea), with escalation in adolescence/adulthood via coffee, energy drinks.",
    "prognosis": "Symptoms of intoxication or withdrawal are usually self-limited; prognosis is excellent with symptom management and gradual tapering if needed.",
