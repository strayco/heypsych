    "description": "Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD) is characterized by a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by ≥5 of: (1) Difficulty making everyday decisions without excessive advice/reassurance; (2) Needs others to assume responsibility for most major life areas; (3) Difficulty expressing disagreement due to fear of loss of support; (4) Difficulty initiating projects on their own; (5) Goes to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance/support; (6) Feels uncomfortable/helpless when alone; (7) Urgently seeks new relationship as a source of care when one ends; (8) Unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to care for self.",
