    "description": "Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) is characterized by pervasive patterns of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior. Individuals often feel uncomfortable when not the center of attention and may use appearance, charm, or dramatic expression to gain approval.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by ≥5 of: (1) Uncomfortable when not the center of attention; (2) Interaction with others often involves inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior; (3) Rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions; (4) Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention; (5) Speech is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail; (6) Self-dramatization, theatricality, exaggerated emotion; (7) Suggestible (easily influenced by others or circumstances); (8) Considers relationships more intimate than they actually are.",
