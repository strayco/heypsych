A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by ≥3 of: (1) Failure to conform to social norms/laws, (2) Deceitfulness, (3) Impulsivity/failure to plan, (4) Irritability/aggressiveness, (5) Reckless disregard for safety of self/others, (6) Consistent irresponsibility, (7) Lack of remorse. B. At least age 18. C. Evidence of Conduct Disorder before age 15. D. Occurrence not exclusively during schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.",
