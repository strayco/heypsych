    "description": "Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by pervasive instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotions, along with marked impulsivity. The pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in various contexts.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by ≥5 of: (1) Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment; (2) A pattern of unstable and intense relationships alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation; (3) Identity disturbance; (4) Impulsivity in at least two potentially self-damaging areas; (5) Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, or self-mutilating behavior; (6) Affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood; (7) Chronic feelings of emptiness; (8) Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger; (9) Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.",
