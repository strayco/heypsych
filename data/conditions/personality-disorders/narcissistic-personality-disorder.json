    "description": "Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in various contexts. Individuals may have an inflated sense of self-importance, overestimate achievements, and expect to be recognized as superior without commensurate accomplishments.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by ≥5 of: (1) Grandiose sense of self-importance; (2) Preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love; (3) Believes they are 'special' and can only be understood by, or associate with, other special or high-status people; (4) Requires excessive admiration; (5) Sense of entitlement; (6) Interpersonally exploitative; (7) Lacks empathy; (8) Often envious of others or believes others are envious of them; (9) Shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes.",
