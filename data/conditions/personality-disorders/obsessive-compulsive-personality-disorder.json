    "description": "Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) is a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. Unlike OCD, it does not require intrusive obsessions or compulsions and is ego-syntonic, with individuals often viewing their behavior as appropriate or advantageous.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by ≥4 of: (1) Preoccupation with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the extent that the major point is lost; (2) Perfectionism that interferes with task completion; (3) Excessive devotion to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure and friendships; (4) Overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values; (5) Unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even without sentimental value; (6) Reluctant to delegate tasks unless others submit exactly to their way; (7) Adopts a miserly spending style toward self and others; (8) Shows rigidity and stubbornness.",
