    "description": "A pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships, along with cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentric behaviors, beginning in early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A pattern of social/interpersonal deficits with cognitive/perceptual distortions and eccentric behavior, beginning by early adulthood, indicated by 5 or more: (1) ideas of reference, (2) odd beliefs or magical thinking, (3) unusual perceptual experiences, (4) odd thinking and speech, (5) suspiciousness or paranoid ideation, (6) inappropriate/constricted affect, (7) odd or eccentric behavior/appearance, (8) lack of close friends/confidants, (9) excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with familiarity. Does not occur exclusively during schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or depressive disorder with psychotic features.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated around 3% of the general population; more common in first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia.",
    "age_of_onset": "Early adulthood; traits may be observed in adolescence.",
    "prognosis": "Often chronic; some individuals may progress to schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Functioning can improve with treatment, but social and occupational impairment is common.",
