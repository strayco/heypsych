    "description": "Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) is a trauma- and stressor-related disorder of early childhood characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially. It occurs in children who have experienced extremes of insufficient care, leading to inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward adult caregivers and limited positive affect.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward adult caregivers, with both: (1) rarely/minimally seeking comfort when distressed, and (2) rarely/minimally responding to comfort when distressed. B. Persistent social and emotional disturbance with at least two of: minimal social/emotional responsiveness to others; limited positive affect; episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness, or fearfulness during nonthreatening interactions. C. The child has experienced extremes of insufficient care (e.g., social neglect/deprivation, repeated caregiver changes, rearing in settings limiting attachments). D. The care in Criterion C is presumed responsible for the disturbance. E. Criteria not met for Autism Spectrum Disorder. F. Evident before age 5. G. Developmental age at least 9 months. Specify if persistent (>12 months) and/or severe (all symptoms at high levels).",
    "prevalence": "Rare in the general population; most common among children who have experienced severe neglect, institutional rearing, or multiple foster placements.",
    "age_of_onset": "Emerges after 9 months of age and before age 5, when attachment should be established; often recognized in toddler/preschool years.",
    "prognosis": "With early, stable, nurturing caregiving, many children show significant improvement; untreated, may lead to ongoing relational difficulties, emotional dysregulation, and risk for other psychiatric disorders.",
