    "description": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that develops after exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. It is characterized by intrusive memories, avoidance of trauma reminders, negative changes in cognition and mood, and increased arousal. Symptoms persist for more than one month and cause significant distress or impairment.",

      "acute_stress_disorder": {
        "description": "Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) shares many symptoms with PTSD but occurs within 3 days to 1 month of trauma exposure. It includes intrusion, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal symptoms. If symptoms last beyond one month, PTSD may be diagnosed.",
        "duration": "3 days to 1 month after trauma.",
        "importance": "Identifying ASD early allows for timely interventions that may reduce progression to PTSD."

        "description": "Complex PTSD, recognized in ICD-11 but not in DSM-5, results from chronic or repeated trauma (e.g., long-term abuse, captivity).
