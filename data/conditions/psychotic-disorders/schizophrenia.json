    "description": "A chronic mental disorder characterized by persistent disturbances in thought, perception, emotions, and behavior, often including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and impaired functioning.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Two or more of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated), and at least one must be (1), (2), or (3): (1) delusions, (2) hallucinations, (3) disorganized speech, (4) grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, (5) negative symptoms. B. For a significant portion of the time since onset, level of functioning in one or more major areas (work, interpersonal relations, self-care) is markedly below the level achieved prior to onset. C. Continuous signs of disturbance persist for at least 6 months, with at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms. D. Schizoaffective disorder and mood disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out. E. Not attributable to a substance or another medical condition.",
    "prevalence": "Lifetime prevalence is approximately 0.3%–0.7% worldwide.",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically late adolescence to early 30s; earlier onset in males (late teens to early 20s) than females (mid-20s to early 30s).",
