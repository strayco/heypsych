    "description": "Brief Psychotic Disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, lasting at least one day but less than one month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms: (1) delusions, (2) hallucinations, (3) disorganized speech, (4) grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior. At least one must be (1), (2), or (3). B. Duration of an episode is at least 1 day but less than 1 month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning. C. The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder, and is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.",
