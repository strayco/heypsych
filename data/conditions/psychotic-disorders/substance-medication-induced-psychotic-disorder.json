    "description": "Prominent hallucinations and/or delusions that are judged to be the direct physiological effect of a substance (drug of abuse, medication, toxin) and arise during or soon after intoxication, withdrawal, or exposure. The disturbance is not better explained by a primary psychotic disorder and does not occur exclusively during delirium.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Presence of delusions and/or hallucinations. B. Evidence from history, exam, or labs that symptoms developed during/soon after substance intoxication, withdrawal, or exposure to a medication and the substance is capable of producing such symptoms. C. Not better explained by a primary psychotic disorder (e.g., symptoms precede substance use, persist >1 month after cessation, or there is other evidence of an independent disorder). D. Does not occur exclusively during a delirium. E. Causes clinically significant distress or impairment.",
    "prevalence": "Varies by substance and setting; higher with high-potency cannabis, stimulants (amphetamines, cocaine), PCP/ketamine, and in emergency/inpatient populations.",
    "age_of_onset": "Any age depending on exposure; often late adolescence to early adulthood for substances of abuse.",
    "prognosis": "Often resolves within days to weeks of abstinence and treatment. A subset transitions to a primary psychotic disorder, especially with early heavy cannabis/stimulant exposure, family history of psychosis, or persistent symptoms beyond 1 month.",
