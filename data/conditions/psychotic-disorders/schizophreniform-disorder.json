    "description": "Schizophreniform Disorder is characterized by symptoms identical to schizophrenia but with a duration of at least 1 month and less than 6 months. Functional decline may not be required for diagnosis. Some individuals recover fully, while others progress to schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Two or more of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated), at least one must be (1), (2), or (3): (1) delusions, (2) hallucinations, (3) disorganized speech, (4) grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, (5) negative symptoms. B. Episode lasts at least 1 month but less than 6 months. C. Schizoaffective disorder and mood disorders with psychotic features have been ruled out. D. Not due to substance/medical condition.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated low prevalence; more common in adolescents and young adults.",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically late adolescence to early adulthood.",
    "prognosis": "Approximately one-third recover within 6 months, while two-thirds develop schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Better prognosis with rapid onset, confusion, good premorbid functioning, and absence of blunted affect.",
