    "description": "A mental health condition characterized by an uninterrupted period of illness featuring concurrent symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech/behavior, negative symptoms) and major mood episodes (major depressive or manic).",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Uninterrupted period of illness during which there is a major mood episode (depressive or manic) concurrent with Criterion A of schizophrenia. B. Delusions or hallucinations for 2 or more weeks in the absence of a major mood episode during the lifetime duration of the illness. C. Symptoms meeting criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority of the total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness. D. Not attributable to the effects of a substance or another medical condition.",
    "prevalence": "Lifetime prevalence estimated at 0.3%; less common than schizophrenia but more common than bipolar disorder with psychotic features.",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically emerges in late adolescence to early adulthood, similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder onset patterns.",
