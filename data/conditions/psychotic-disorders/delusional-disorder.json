    "description": "Delusional Disorder is characterized by one or more delusions lasting at least one month without other significant psychotic symptoms such as prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized/catatonic behavior. Functioning is generally preserved outside the delusional context, and mood symptoms, if present, are brief relative to the delusional periods.",
    "diagnostic_criteria": "A. Presence of one or more delusions for ≥1 month. B. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met. C. Functioning is not markedly impaired apart from the impact of the delusion(s). D. If mood episodes occur, they are brief relative to the delusional periods. E. Not attributable to a substance/medical condition or better explained by another mental disorder.",
    "prevalence": "Estimated lifetime prevalence ~0.02%–0.05%; rare compared to schizophrenia.",
    "age_of_onset": "Typically middle to late adulthood, though can occur earlier.",
    "prognosis": "Generally better functional outcome than schizophrenia but delusions may be chronic; risk of social isolation and conflict; some respond to antipsychotics.",
