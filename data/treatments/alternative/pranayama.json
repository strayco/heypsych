  "summary": "A yogic practice of controlled breathing techniques aimed at regulating vital energy (prana), enhancing mental focus, reducing stress, and supporting physical and spiritual wellbeing.",
  "description": "Pranayama, a core limb of yoga described in ancient texts such as the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, involves conscious regulation of inhalation, exhalation, and breath retention to influence physical, mental, and spiritual states. Techniques range from calming (e.g., diaphragmatic, alternate nostril breathing) to energizing (e.g., Kapalabhati, Bhastrika). Pranayama is widely integrated into yoga, meditation, and mind–body medicine programs. Evidence supports benefits for stress reduction, anxiety, sleep, cardiopulmonary function, and autonomic balance, though effects vary by technique and study quality.",
