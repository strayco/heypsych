  "summary": "A paced breathing practice that regulates the autonomic nervous system by aligning inhalations and exhalations to approximately 5–6 breaths per minute.",
  "description": "Coherent breathing is a therapeutic breathing technique that emphasizes slow, rhythmic breathing at a rate of around 5 to 6 breaths per minute, often synchronized with gentle counting or external cues. The practice promotes balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, enhances heart rate variability (HRV), and supports physical and emotional regulation. It is commonly used for stress reduction, anxiety management, and overall well-being, and can be practiced independently or integrated into therapy and meditation programs.",
