  "summary": "An ancient Buddhist practice of insight meditation focused on cultivating awareness of bodily sensations, thoughts, and emotions to develop mindfulness, equanimity, and liberation from suffering.",
  "description": "Vipassana Meditation, meaning 'insight' or 'clear seeing' in Pali, is one of the oldest forms of Buddhist meditation. Revived and popularized in modern times by S.N. Goenka, Vipassana emphasizes non-reactive observation of bodily sensations, mental states, and impermanence. Practitioners systematically scan the body, noting sensations without judgment, which fosters mindfulness, emotional regulation, and deep self-awareness. Traditionally taught in intensive 10-day silent retreats, Vipassana is practiced globally and has influenced secular mindfulness-based interventions. Evidence suggests benefits for stress reduction, anxiety, depression, addiction recovery, and overall well-being, though retreats may be psychologically challenging for some participants.",

Neurologically, research shows changes in brain regions associated with attention, interoception, and emotional regulation (insula, prefrontal cortex). Physiologically, Vipassana reduces sympathetic arousal, decreases cortisol, and increases parasympathetic activation. From a Buddhist framework, the practice reveals impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatta), fostering insight and liberation."
