  "summary": "A therapeutic massage technique that applies firm pressure and slow strokes to reach deeper layers of muscles and connective tissues.",
  "description": "Deep tissue massage is a form of therapeutic massage focused on realigning deeper layers of muscles and fascia (connective tissue). It uses slow, firm strokes and deep finger pressure on specific areas of tension and pain. Unlike relaxation massage, deep tissue massage is intended to release chronic muscle tension, break up adhesions, and improve mobility. It is often used for sports injuries, chronic pain, and musculoskeletal issues. While effective, it may cause temporary soreness and is not suitable for all patients.",
