  "description": "Yoga Therapy is an integrative healing approach that adapts traditional yoga practices to address specific health conditions and individual needs. Unlike general yoga classes, yoga therapy is tailored and therapeutic, often delivered one-on-one or in small groups by trained yoga therapists. Interventions may include physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation, relaxation practices, and lifestyle recommendations. Evidence supports its effectiveness in managing chronic pain, stress, anxiety, depression, cardiovascular conditions, and rehabilitation support. Yoga Therapy is recognized as a complementary approach in integrative medicine and is increasingly incorporated in healthcare and rehabilitation settings.",
