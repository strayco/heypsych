  "summary": "A therapeutic practice that uses gardening, plant care, and interaction with nature as a structured activity to improve mental, emotional, physical, and social well-being.",
  "description": "Horticultural therapy involves the purposeful use of gardening, plant-based activities, and nature interaction facilitated by trained practitioners. It is used in rehabilitation, mental health, elder care, and educational settings. Activities may include planting, weeding, watering, harvesting, or simply spending structured time in nature. Research suggests it can reduce stress, improve mood, enhance attention and memory, and support physical rehabilitation through gentle activity. It also fosters social connection and a sense of purpose. Programs are tailored to participant needs and can be adapted for various age groups and abilities.",
