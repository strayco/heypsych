  "summary": "A clinical, evidence-informed use of music experiences—listening, creating, singing, moving—to achieve individualized health goals in physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains.",
  "description": "Music therapy is a systematic, goal-directed intervention delivered by a credentialed music therapist. Techniques include receptive (guided listening, relaxation), active (instrument play, songwriting, improvisation), and relational (therapeutic singing, movement to music) methods. It is used across the lifespan to reduce anxiety and pain, support mood and trauma recovery, improve communication and social engagement (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), and enhance motor and cognitive rehabilitation (e.g., stroke, Parkinson’s). Sessions are individualized, often integrated with medical, psychological, or rehabilitative care.",
