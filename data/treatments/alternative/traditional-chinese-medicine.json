  "description": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system developed over thousands of years in China, rooted in the concepts of Yin-Yang balance, Qi (vital energy), and the Five Elements. It emphasizes individualized diagnosis and treatment to restore harmony within the body and between the individual and environment. Core TCM modalities include herbal medicine, acupuncture, dietary therapy, Tuina (therapeutic massage), and Qigong/Tai Chi practices. TCM is widely used for a variety of conditions including chronic pain, digestive disorders, women’s health, stress, and preventive wellness. While many of its theories are not directly translatable into biomedical frameworks, growing research supports certain TCM interventions, particularly acupuncture and herbal formulations, in integrative care contexts.",
