  "summary": "A traditional Chinese mind-body practice combining gentle movement, breath regulation, and focused intention to cultivate Qi (vital energy). Used for stress reduction, balance, chronic pain, and overall well-being.",
  "description": "Qigong is a component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that integrates slow, coordinated movements, meditative awareness, and breathing techniques to harmonize body, breath, and mind. It is practiced both as a form of preventive self-care and as a therapeutic adjunct. Modern research suggests benefits through autonomic regulation, improved balance, enhanced vagal tone, reduced stress hormones, and modulation of inflammatory pathways. Variants include medical qigong, martial qigong, and spiritual qigong. It is widely practiced worldwide for wellness, rehabilitation, and supportive care.",
