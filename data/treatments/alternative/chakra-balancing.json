  "summary": "A holistic healing approach focused on aligning and harmonizing the body’s seven primary energy centers (chakras) to support emotional, mental, and physical well-being.",
  "description": "Chakra Balancing is an alternative healing practice rooted in yogic and spiritual traditions. It is based on the belief that the body has seven main chakras—energy centers aligned along the spine from the base to the crown of the head. Imbalances or blockages in these chakras are thought to manifest as emotional distress, mental unease, or physical ailments. Practitioners use methods such as meditation, visualization, sound therapy, Reiki, crystals, yoga postures, and aromatherapy to restore balance, promote relaxation, and enhance overall well-being.",
