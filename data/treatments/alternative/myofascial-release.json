  "description": "Myofascial Release (MFR) is a manual therapy used to treat musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction by addressing restrictions in fascia, the connective tissue surrounding muscles and organs. Practitioners apply gentle, sustained pressure or stretching techniques to release tightness, improve blood and lymphatic flow, and restore movement. MFR is used in physical therapy, massage therapy, and integrative medicine for chronic pain, postural imbalances, fibromyalgia, and recovery from injury. While widely practiced, the evidence base remains mixed, with some studies supporting pain reduction and functional improvements, particularly for chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular disorders.",
