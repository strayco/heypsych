  "summary": "A contemporary energy healing practice involving non-contact or light-touch techniques intended to balance the human energy field and promote relaxation and healing.",
  "description": "Therapeutic Touch (TT) is a modern energy-based healing modality developed in the 1970s by Dolores Krieger, PhD, RN, and Dora Kunz. It is grounded in the concept that practitioners can attune to and influence a patient’s biofield (energy field) to promote healing. The technique involves centering by the practitioner, assessing energy flow with hands held near the body, and using sweeping or modulating movements to clear congestion and restore balance. TT is widely used by nurses and integrative health practitioners for pain relief, stress reduction, and enhancement of healing in various populations. While evidence is mixed and mechanisms remain theoretical, many patients report subjective benefits in relaxation, comfort, and pain relief.",
