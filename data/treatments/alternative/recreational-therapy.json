  "description": "Recreational therapy (also called therapeutic recreation) is a health and rehabilitation discipline that uses recreational activities—such as arts and crafts, games, music, sports, outdoor activities, and social events—within a structured treatment plan. It is designed to restore, remediate, and promote functioning and independence in life activities, while also enhancing health, well-being, and quality of life. Recreational therapists assess individual needs and use activity-based interventions tailored to specific goals, such as reducing anxiety, improving social skills, increasing physical mobility, or supporting emotional expression. It is practiced across hospitals, rehabilitation centers, schools, community programs, and long-term care facilities.",
