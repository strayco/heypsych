  "description": "Poetry therapy (also called bibliotherapy/poetic medicine in some contexts) uses literature—especially poems—and guided writing to facilitate expression, reflection, and connection. Sessions may include reading selected poems, discussing themes and emotions, and composing original poems or reflective writings. Techniques can enhance emotional awareness, meaning-making, self-compassion, and interpersonal connection. It is used across mental health, medical, educational, and community settings as an adjunct to psychotherapy and rehabilitation.",
