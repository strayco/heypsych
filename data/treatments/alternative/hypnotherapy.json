  "summary": "A therapeutic technique that uses guided relaxation, focused attention, and suggestion in a trance-like state to modify behaviors, reduce symptoms, and support psychological and medical treatments.",
  "description": "Hypnotherapy is the clinical application of hypnosis for therapeutic purposes. By inducing a trance-like state of heightened focus and suggestibility, a trained practitioner helps clients explore subconscious processes and adopt new patterns of thought or behavior. Hypnotherapy is used in psychotherapy, pain management, stress reduction, and treatment of conditions like phobias, insomnia, and irritable bowel syndrome. While not a stand-alone cure, it can serve as an effective adjunct to conventional psychological and medical interventions. Evidence supports its role in managing pain, anxiety, and functional disorders, though outcomes vary by individual and practitioner skill.",
