  "summary": "An integrative therapeutic approach that uses multiple art forms—such as visual arts, music, dance, drama, and writing—to promote emotional expression, healing, and personal growth.",
  "description": "Expressive Arts Therapy is a multimodal form of psychotherapy that encourages individuals to explore and express their inner experiences through a combination of creative practices, including visual arts, music, movement, drama, poetry, and storytelling. Unlike single-modality therapies (e.g., art therapy or music therapy), expressive arts therapy integrates multiple artistic methods within the therapeutic process. The approach emphasizes process over product, aiming to help clients access emotions, foster self-awareness, and discover new perspectives on their struggles. It is used in mental health, medical, educational, and community settings to address trauma, anxiety, depression, grief, and personal development. Evidence suggests benefits in emotional regulation, resilience, and self-expression, though high-quality clinical trials remain limited.",
