  "summary": "A gentle, deeply relaxing yoga practice using props to support the body in passive postures, promoting rest, recovery, and regulation of the nervous system.",
  "description": "Restorative yoga is a therapeutic style of yoga that emphasizes relaxation, gentle stretching, and mindful presence. Unlike active yoga practices, restorative yoga uses props (bolsters, blankets, blocks) to fully support the body in restful postures, often held for 5–20 minutes. The goal is not muscular effort but conscious relaxation, facilitating parasympathetic nervous system activation, stress reduction, improved sleep, and emotional balance. Widely used in integrative health, stress management, trauma recovery, and chronic illness, restorative yoga provides accessible, non-invasive support for physical and mental well-being.",
