  "summary": "An experiential therapeutic approach that uses outdoor activities, group challenges, and adventure-based experiences to promote psychological growth, resilience, and behavioral change.",
  "description": "Adventure therapy combines elements of psychotherapy with outdoor experiential learning. It uses structured activities such as hiking, rock climbing, ropes courses, camping, and group challenges to facilitate self-discovery, build coping skills, and foster interpersonal growth. Rooted in experiential education, wilderness therapy, and group therapy traditions, it is used with diverse populations including adolescents, veterans, individuals with behavioral health issues, and corporate/leadership groups. Evidence supports benefits for mental health, substance use recovery, social skills, and resilience, though quality of evidence varies.",
