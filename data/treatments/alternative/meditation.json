  "summary": "A diverse set of mind-body practices that train attention, awareness, and emotional regulation through techniques such as focused attention, open monitoring, or mantra repetition. Widely used for stress reduction, emotional balance, and personal growth.",
  "description": "Meditation is an umbrella term for contemplative practices that involve intentionally training attention and awareness. It includes traditions from Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and secular psychology. Common approaches include focused attention (on breath or an object), open monitoring (awareness of present-moment experience), compassion practices (e.g., loving-kindness), and mantra-based techniques. Modern research shows meditation can reduce stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; enhance emotion regulation and cognitive flexibility; and support physical health by reducing blood pressure and improving sleep. Different styles vary in goals—from relaxation to cultivating compassion or achieving insight. Meditation is widely integrated into healthcare, wellness, education, and corporate programs.",
