  "summary": "A somatic education approach using gentle movement and directed attention to improve posture, coordination, and ease of movement, often reducing pain and enhancing function.",
  "description": "The Feldenkrais Method is a learning-based, neuro-somatic practice developed by Moshe Feldenkrais. It uses two primary modalities—Awareness Through Movement (ATM) group lessons and one-to-one Functional Integration (FI) sessions—to help people sense inefficient movement habits and discover more comfortable, efficient patterns. By pairing slow, varied movements with mindful attention, the method aims to refine body maps, improve motor organization, and reduce unnecessary muscular effort. It is used for chronic pain, musculoskeletal disorders, balance and gait issues, performing arts optimization, and neurological conditions (as an adjunct).",
