  "description": "Tai Chi (Taijiquan) is a traditional Chinese martial art and mind-body exercise characterized by slow, graceful, and continuous movements coordinated with breath and mental focus. Originally developed as a martial practice, it is now widely practiced worldwide for its health benefits, including stress reduction, balance enhancement, improved flexibility, and overall well-being. Tai Chi emphasizes mindful movement, postural alignment, and the cultivation of 'Qi' (vital energy). Research supports its role in fall prevention among older adults, management of chronic pain, and adjunctive therapy for conditions such as anxiety, hypertension, and fibromyalgia. It is gentle, adaptable, and safe across a wide range of ages and fitness levels.",
