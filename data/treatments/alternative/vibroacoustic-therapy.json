  "summary": "A sound-based therapy using low-frequency vibrations delivered through specialized equipment to promote relaxation, reduce pain, and support physical and emotional well-being.",
  "description": "Vibroacoustic Therapy (VAT) is a therapeutic modality that applies low-frequency sound vibrations (typically 30–120 Hz) to the body using specially designed chairs, beds, or mats embedded with transducers. Developed by Olav Skille in the 1980s, VAT aims to reduce muscle tension, enhance circulation, and promote relaxation by combining tactile vibration with auditory stimulation. It has been studied for use in pain management, neurological conditions, stress reduction, and rehabilitation. Research suggests VAT may improve mobility, sleep, and mood, though the evidence base remains limited and heterogeneous. It is non-invasive and often integrated into complementary medicine, physiotherapy, and wellness practices.",
