  "summary": "A spiritual and therapeutic yoga tradition combining postures, breathwork, mantra chanting, and meditation aimed at awakening inner energy (kundalini) and promoting physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.",
  "description": "Kundalini Yoga is a dynamic style of yoga that integrates physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), mantra chanting, hand gestures (mudras), and meditation. Rooted in Tantric and Sikh traditions, it emphasizes awakening kundalini energy, conceptualized as a dormant spiritual force at the base of the spine. Practices are structured in 'kriyas'—set sequences designed for specific outcomes (e.g., stress relief, detoxification, emotional balance). In modern health settings, Kundalini Yoga has been studied for its benefits in stress reduction, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and substance use recovery. It is typically practiced in group classes led by certified instructors and includes both physical exertion and deep meditative elements.",

Physiologically, breath of fire and rhythmic movements modulate vagal tone, heart rate variability, and stress hormones. Meditation and chanting may influence attention networks, emotional regulation, and neuroplasticity. Symbolically, it is described as awakening 'kundalini energy' rising through chakras to support spiritual and psychological integration."
