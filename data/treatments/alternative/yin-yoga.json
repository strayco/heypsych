  "description": "Yin Yoga is a contemplative practice that emphasizes stillness and long-held, passive stretches (typically 2–7 minutes per pose). Rooted in Taoist philosophy and influenced by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Yin Yoga aims to balance the body's energy by stimulating meridians while enhancing flexibility in connective tissues such as fascia, ligaments, and joints. It complements more active (yang) practices like Vinyasa or power yoga. Practitioners report benefits including increased range of motion, reduced stress, improved circulation, and deeper mindfulness. Yin Yoga is widely practiced in wellness, rehabilitation, and integrative health contexts.",
