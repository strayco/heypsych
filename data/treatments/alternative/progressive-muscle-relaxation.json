  "summary": "A relaxation technique that involves systematically tensing and releasing muscle groups to reduce physical tension and promote mental calmness.",
  "description": "Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR), developed by Edmund Jacobson in the 1920s, is a structured relaxation practice in which individuals sequentially tense and relax different muscle groups throughout the body. By focusing attention on bodily sensations of tension and release, PMR promotes relaxation, reduces stress and anxiety, improves sleep, and enhances mind–body awareness. It is widely used in behavioral medicine, psychotherapy, pain management, and wellness programs, often as part of stress reduction or cognitive-behavioral interventions.",
