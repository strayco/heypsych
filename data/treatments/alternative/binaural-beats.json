  "summary": "An auditory stimulation technique that uses two slightly different frequencies presented separately to each ear, producing a perceived beat that may influence brainwave activity.",
  "description": "Binaural beats occur when two tones of slightly different frequencies are played separately into each ear, creating the illusion of a rhythmic beat at the frequency difference. This beat is thought to entrain brainwave activity and potentially induce states associated with relaxation, focus, meditation, or sleep. Binaural beats are delivered through headphones and are often incorporated into wellness, meditation, or self-improvement practices. While widely popular in consumer wellness applications, clinical evidence is mixed and remains an area of ongoing research.",
