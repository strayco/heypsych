  "summary": "A gentle, hands-on therapy aimed at releasing restrictions in the craniosacral system to promote relaxation, balance, and self-healing.",
  "description": "Craniosacral Therapy (CST) is a complementary and alternative therapy developed from osteopathic medicine. Practitioners use gentle touch to evaluate and release restrictions in the craniosacral system—comprised of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The therapy is believed to enhance the body’s natural healing processes, improve nervous system function, and reduce pain and stress. While some patients report benefits such as relaxation and reduced tension, CST remains controversial due to limited high-quality evidence supporting its efficacy.",
