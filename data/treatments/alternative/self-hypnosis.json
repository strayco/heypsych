  "summary": "A self-directed mind-body practice using focused attention, relaxation, and autosuggestion to influence psychological and physiological states for therapeutic benefit.",
  "description": "Self-hypnosis is a cognitive-behavioral and mind-body technique in which individuals guide themselves into a hypnotic or trance-like state for therapeutic purposes. It typically involves relaxation, focused concentration, and the use of positive suggestions or imagery to achieve specific goals such as pain reduction, stress management, or behavior change. Unlike therapist-guided hypnosis, self-hypnosis empowers individuals to apply techniques independently, often after initial training. Research indicates efficacy for pain control, anxiety reduction, sleep improvement, and habit management, although outcomes depend on suggestibility, practice, and guidance quality.",
