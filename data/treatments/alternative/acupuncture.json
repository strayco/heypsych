  "summary": "A traditional East Asian medical practice that inserts very fine needles at specific body points to modulate pain pathways, autonomic tone, and homeostatic mechanisms. Used for pain, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, and functional disorders.",
  "description": "Acupuncture is a component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that aims to restore physiological balance by stimulating defined points on the body (acupoints) with filiform needles. Modern research suggests effects on endogenous opioid release, serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways, local neuroimmune signaling, and autonomic regulation. Variants include manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture, auricular acupuncture, and acupressure. It is widely integrated into pain management and supportive care and has growing evidence for certain conditions, while other uses remain investigational.",

Locally, it impacts neuroimmune signaling and microcirculation. In TCM theory, acupuncture regulates Qi and blood by harmonizing meridians and organ systems to restore homeostasis."
