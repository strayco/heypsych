  "description": "Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT), or Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM), is practiced by licensed Doctors of Osteopathy (DOs) as part of comprehensive medical care. It involves hands-on assessment and treatment of the musculoskeletal system to improve biomechanics, enhance circulation and lymphatic flow, reduce pain, and optimize physiologic function. Techniques include soft tissue stretching, joint mobilization, myofascial release, cranial osteopathy, lymphatic drainage, and high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) thrusts. OMT is integrated with conventional medicine and is most commonly used for musculoskeletal pain, but it may also support respiratory, neurologic, and systemic conditions.",
