  "summary": "A contemplative practice involving nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, widely used for stress reduction, emotional regulation, and mental health support.",
  "description": "Mindfulness meditation, derived from Buddhist traditions and adapted into secular programs, trains attention and awareness by focusing on present-moment experiences with openness and nonjudgment. Practices often involve awareness of breathing, body sensations, emotions, or thoughts without attachment or aversion. Mindfulness-based interventions such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) have strong evidence for reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and improving quality of life. It can be practiced informally in daily activities or in structured meditations, both guided and self-directed.",
