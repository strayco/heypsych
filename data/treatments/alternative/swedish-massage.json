  "summary": "A widely practiced massage technique using long gliding strokes, kneading, tapping, and gentle joint movements to promote relaxation, circulation, and stress relief.",
  "description": "Swedish massage, developed in the 19th century by Per Henrik Ling, is one of the most common forms of therapeutic massage worldwide. It uses a combination of techniques—effleurage (long gliding strokes), petrissage (kneading), tapotement (rhythmic tapping), friction, and gentle stretching—to relax muscles, enhance circulation, and support general well-being. Often used for stress reduction, pain relief, and relaxation, Swedish massage can also improve flexibility and promote recovery from minor injuries. It is a foundation for many other massage styles and is widely integrated into wellness and clinical settings. Research supports benefits for stress reduction, pain management, and quality of life.",
