  "summary": "A system of alternative medicine founded on the principles of 'like cures like' and potentization (serial dilution with succussion). Remedies are selected based on symptom similarity and are typically highly diluted.",
  "description": "Homeopathy, developed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century, proposes that substances causing symptoms in healthy individuals can, in highly diluted form, treat similar symptoms in the unwell ('similia similibus curentur'). Preparations undergo serial dilution and vigorous shaking ('succussion'), believed by proponents to imprint therapeutic properties despite minimal or no remaining molecules of the original substance at high potencies (e.g., 30C, 200C). Homeopathy is used for a wide array of complaints (e.g., allergies, colds, anxiety, chronic pain). Scientific consensus holds that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebo for most conditions; perceived benefits are often attributed to placebo/context effects and the lengthy, supportive consultation style. Safety concerns relate primarily to delaying or replacing effective care and to quality problems in certain products.",
