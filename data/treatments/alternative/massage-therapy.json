  "summary": "A manual therapy involving structured manipulation of soft tissues to reduce pain, relieve muscle tension, improve circulation, and promote relaxation and well-being.",
  "description": "Massage therapy is a hands-on treatment that manipulates muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia to address pain, stress, and functional impairments. Modalities vary from gentle relaxation techniques (Swedish massage) to targeted deep pressure approaches (deep tissue, trigger point). Massage is widely used for musculoskeletal pain, stress, anxiety, rehabilitation, and general wellness. Evidence supports its role in short-term pain relief, relaxation, and anxiety reduction, with emerging evidence in rehabilitation and chronic conditions when integrated with conventional care.",
