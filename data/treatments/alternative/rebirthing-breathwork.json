  "summary": "A breathing-based therapeutic practice using conscious connected breathing to access altered states of awareness, release emotional trauma, and promote psychological integration. Often positioned within transpersonal and alternative healing traditions.",
  "description": "Rebirthing Breathwork, also called Conscious Energy Breathing (CEB), is an alternative therapeutic approach that uses continuous, connected breathing patterns without pauses between inhalation and exhalation. Developed in the 1970s by Leonard Orr, it was initially linked to re-experiencing birth trauma but has since expanded to address emotional release, stress, and self-discovery. Practitioners believe it helps clear unresolved trauma, enhance vitality, and promote spiritual growth. Contemporary forms are practiced as guided individual or group sessions, often incorporating affirmations, bodywork, or integrative counseling. While many participants report cathartic experiences and improved well-being, the evidence base is limited, and risks include psychological destabilization in vulnerable individuals.",

In transpersonal frameworks, it is described as reconnecting with early life imprints and facilitating integration of unconscious material."
