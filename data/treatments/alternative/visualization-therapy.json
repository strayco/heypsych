  "summary": "A mind-body technique that uses guided imagery and mental visualization to promote relaxation, improve performance, and support physical and emotional healing.",
  "description": "Visualization Therapy, also known as guided imagery, is a mental practice in which individuals imagine calming, healing, or goal-oriented images and scenarios to influence physical, psychological, and behavioral outcomes. The practice draws on the connection between mind and body, engaging sensory imagination to activate relaxation responses, reduce stress, and support healing. Used in psychotherapy, sports performance, stress management, and integrative medicine, visualization may involve self-directed imagery or facilitator-guided sessions. Evidence supports benefits in pain reduction, anxiety management, athletic performance, and recovery from illness, though outcomes vary by context and individual receptivity.",

Imagining calming scenes reduces sympathetic nervous system arousal and enhances parasympathetic activation. In sports psychology, visualization activates neural pathways similar to actual performance, reinforcing motor skills and confidence. Healing visualizations may influence immune and endocrine responses via psychoneuroimmunological mechanisms, though this remains under investigation."
