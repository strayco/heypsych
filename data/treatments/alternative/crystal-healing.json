  "summary": "A spiritual and energy-based practice that uses crystals and gemstones to promote healing, balance, and well-being.",
  "description": "Crystal healing is an alternative therapy based on the belief that crystals and gemstones can interact with the body’s energy fields to promote physical, emotional, and spiritual healing. Practitioners often place crystals on or around the body, aligning them with chakras or specific energy points, or recommend carrying them as amulets. While crystal healing is widely popular in holistic and spiritual communities, there is no scientific evidence that crystals have intrinsic healing properties. Reported benefits are largely attributed to relaxation, ritual, and the placebo effect.",
