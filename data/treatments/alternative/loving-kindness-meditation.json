  "summary": "A compassion cultivation practice that uses phrases of goodwill toward oneself and others to increase positive affect, reduce stress, and strengthen social connection.",
  "description": "Loving-Kindness Meditation (often called Metta) is a contemplative practice from Buddhist traditions adapted for secular well-being. Practitioners silently repeat phrases of goodwill (e.g., “May I be safe, healthy, peaceful”) directed first to oneself, then progressively to loved ones, neutral people, difficult people, and all beings. Research suggests LKM can increase positive emotions and compassion, reduce stress and depressive symptoms, and improve social connection and self-criticism. It can be taught as a stand-alone skill, integrated within mindfulness programs, or used clinically as an adjunct for mood and trauma-related difficulties.",
