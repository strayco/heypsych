  "summary": "A licensed, evidence-based rehabilitation profession that helps people participate in meaningful daily activities (occupations) through skill-building, adaptation, and environmental modification.",
  "description": "Occupational Therapy enables people across the lifespan to do what matters to them—self-care, work/school, play, and community participation. OTs use activity analysis, graded practice, assistive technology, cognitive and motor rehabilitation, and environmental modifications to optimize function after injury, illness, disability, or mental health challenges. Practice spans hospitals, rehab, schools, primary care, and community settings. OT is strongly evidence-based for improving functional independence and quality of life in numerous conditions (e.g., stroke, hand injury, developmental and mental health conditions).",
