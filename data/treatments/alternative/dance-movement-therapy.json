  "summary": "A psychotherapeutic approach that uses movement and dance to promote emotional, cognitive, physical, and social integration.",
  "description": "Dance/Movement Therapy (DMT) is an expressive therapy that integrates movement, dance, and psychotherapeutic principles. It is based on the premise that the body and mind are interconnected, and movement can be a powerful tool for self-expression, healing, and growth. DMT is facilitated by trained therapists and can be used with individuals, groups, or families to improve mental health, enhance body awareness, support trauma recovery, and foster emotional regulation. Unlike recreational dance, DMT emphasizes the therapeutic process rather than performance.",
