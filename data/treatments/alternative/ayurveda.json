  "summary": "A comprehensive traditional medical system from India emphasizing individualized lifestyle, diet, herbal formulas, bodywork, and detoxification to restore balance among the doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha).",
  "description": "Ayurveda is a traditional South Asian medical system with roots >2,000 years old. It aims to optimize health by assessing constitutional type (prakriti) and imbalances (vikriti) across three doshas—Vata, Pitta, Kapha. Treatments blend lifestyle and diet, botanical medicines (single herbs and multi-herb formulations), body-based therapies (abhyanga massage, shirodhara), yoga and breathwork, and cleansing procedures (Panchakarma). Modern research suggests potential benefits for osteoarthritis, metabolic risk factors, stress, and some functional disorders, while evidence quality varies. Safety depends on qualified guidance, product quality, and appropriate integration with conventional care.",
