  "summary": "A nature-based therapeutic intervention that uses outdoor expeditions and group living experiences to support psychological healing, resilience, and personal growth.",
  "description": "Wilderness Therapy is an experiential and nature-based treatment approach often used for adolescents and young adults struggling with emotional, behavioral, or substance use issues. It combines outdoor living, group activities, and survival skills training with therapeutic interventions such as individual counseling, group therapy, and reflective practices. Programs are typically structured as multi-week expeditions, designed to build resilience, enhance self-efficacy, and foster healthy coping mechanisms. Research suggests potential benefits for reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and substance misuse, as well as improving interpersonal skills and self-esteem. However, variability in program quality and safety considerations have been noted.",
