  "summary": "A therapeutic technique using guided relaxation, focused attention, and suggestion to promote psychological and physiological changes.",
  "description": "Clinical hypnosis is a therapeutic practice in which a trained clinician guides an individual into a focused, trance-like state of heightened suggestibility and concentration. In this state, patients may be more open to therapeutic suggestions intended to alter perceptions, emotions, behaviors, or physical sensations. Unlike stage hypnosis, clinical hypnosis is used in medical and psychological contexts to support treatment of pain, anxiety, phobias, and habits like smoking. It is generally considered safe when conducted by trained professionals, though effectiveness varies across conditions.",
