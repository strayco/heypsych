  "summary": "A standardized self-relaxation method that uses scripted phrases and passive concentration to elicit a relaxation response, reduce stress and anxiety, and improve sleep and autonomic regulation.",
  "description": "Autogenic Training (AT), developed by Johannes Schultz in the early 20th century, is a structured mind–body technique in which individuals repeatedly practice formulaic self-statements (e.g., sensations of heaviness, warmth, calm breathing) while adopting a passive, non-striving mental attitude. Through regular practice, AT aims to downshift sympathetic arousal and cultivate autonomic balance. It is commonly taught over several sessions and then continued as a self-care practice. Evidence supports benefits for anxiety, stress-related symptoms, insomnia, headache, and functional somatic complaints; effects on blood pressure and chronic pain are modest but potentially helpful as adjuncts.",
