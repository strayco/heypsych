  "summary": "A structured meditation technique involving silent repetition of a personalized mantra to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and enhance overall well-being.",
  "description": "Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a widely practiced form of meditation introduced by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the 1950s. TM involves silently repeating a specific mantra, assigned by a trained teacher, for 20 minutes twice daily while sitting comfortably with eyes closed. Unlike concentration or mindfulness practices, TM emphasizes effortless mental repetition, allowing the mind to settle into a state of restful awareness. TM has been studied extensively, with evidence suggesting benefits in stress reduction, cardiovascular health, anxiety, and quality of life. It is taught exclusively through certified TM instructors and is associated with a standardized training program and international organization.",
