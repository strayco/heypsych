  "summary": "Formulas derived from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) combining multiple herbs and natural substances to address pattern-based diagnoses and support symptom relief and functional balance.",
  "description": "Chinese herbal medicine is a core component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that uses multi-herb formulas tailored to an individual’s pattern of disharmony (e.g., Qi, Blood, Yin/Yang, organ meridian patterns). Classical formulas are modified by licensed practitioners to match presentation and stage of illness. From a biomedical perspective, Chinese herbs contain diverse phytochemicals that may exert anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, or gastrointestinal effects. Evidence is strongest for a limited number of conditions and specific standardized products; quality and safety depend on sourcing, correct diagnosis, dosing, and avoidance of herb–drug interactions.",
