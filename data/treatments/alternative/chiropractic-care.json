  "summary": "A manual therapy focused on diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal issues, especially those involving the spine, through spinal adjustments, manipulations, and related techniques.",
  "description": "Chiropractic care is a widely used complementary and alternative medicine approach centered on the relationship between the spine and the nervous system. Chiropractors use spinal adjustments, joint manipulations, soft tissue therapies, and lifestyle guidance to address pain, improve mobility, and support overall wellness. While most commonly sought for back and neck pain, chiropractic care is also promoted for a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. It is generally considered safe when performed by licensed practitioners, though risks exist if applied improperly or in high-risk individuals.",
