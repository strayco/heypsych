  "summary": "A traditional Buddhist meditation practice emphasizing seated stillness, posture, and mindful awareness, fostering insight, calm, and presence.",
  "description": "Zen Meditation, or Zazen, is the central practice of Zen Buddhism, involving seated meditation with upright posture, regulated breathing, and focused or open awareness. Unlike techniques that emphasize visualization or mantra, Zazen often emphasizes 'just sitting' (Shikantaza) or concentration on breath, koans, or physical sensations. The practice cultivates mindfulness, equanimity, and insight into the nature of mind and reality. While traditionally a spiritual practice, it has been adapted in modern contexts for stress reduction, emotional regulation, and psychological health. Research supports benefits for anxiety, depression, attention, and overall well-being.",
