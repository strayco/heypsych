  "summary": "A microsystem form of acupuncture that stimulates specific points on the outer ear to influence pain, stress, addiction, and functional disorders.",
  "description": "Auricular acupuncture is a specialized form of acupuncture based on the concept that the ear is a microsystem representing the entire body. Fine needles, seeds, or electrical stimulation are applied to auricular points mapped to somatic and visceral functions. Traditional Chinese Medicine and modern neurophysiological models suggest modulation of autonomic tone, pain pathways, and limbic regulation. Auricular protocols are widely used for pain, anxiety, insomnia, and addiction support, including standardized systems such as the NADA protocol for substance use. While evidence supports some applications (e.g., pain, perioperative anxiety), research quality varies across conditions.",
