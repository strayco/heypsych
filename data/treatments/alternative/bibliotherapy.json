  "summary": "A therapeutic approach that uses reading materials—fiction, nonfiction, or self-help books—as tools for psychological growth, insight, and healing.",
  "description": "Bibliotherapy involves the intentional use of literature to support mental health and personal development. It can include self-help manuals, novels, poetry, or therapeutic workbooks. The idea is that exposure to specific texts can provide psychoeducation, foster emotional expression, enhance empathy, and encourage problem-solving. Bibliotherapy may be guided by a clinician or pursued independently, often in combination with psychotherapy or support groups. It has been studied as a cost-effective and accessible adjunct for conditions such as depression, anxiety, stress, and grief.",
