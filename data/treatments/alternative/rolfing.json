  "summary": "A manual therapy system focusing on deep manipulation of fascia and connective tissue to improve posture, movement, and body alignment.",
  "description": "Rolfing® Structural Integration is a form of manual therapy developed by Dr. Ida Rolf in the mid-20th century. It emphasizes reorganizing the body's myofascial system (connective tissue) through deep, systematic manipulation, combined with movement education. Practitioners aim to improve alignment with gravity, relieve chronic tension, and enhance mobility. Unlike massage, Rolfing follows a structured series of sessions targeting specific body regions to integrate the whole system. Clients often report improved posture, decreased pain, and greater body awareness. While widely practiced as an alternative therapy, research evidence is still limited, though some studies suggest benefits for chronic musculoskeletal conditions and well-being.",
