  "summary": "A sound-based healing practice using Tibetan or crystal singing bowls to produce harmonic vibrations intended to promote relaxation, balance energy, and support emotional well-being.",
  "description": "Singing Bowl Therapy is a form of sound healing that uses Tibetan metal bowls or crystal singing bowls to create resonant tones and vibrations. Traditionally rooted in Himalayan spiritual practices, it is now widely used in wellness, meditation, and integrative care settings. Practitioners strike or rub the rim of the bowls to produce sustained tones that are believed to influence brainwave states, reduce stress, and harmonize the body’s energy field. Participants often report deep relaxation, emotional release, and improved well-being. While scientific evidence remains limited, preliminary studies suggest potential benefits for stress reduction, mood, and pain management.",
