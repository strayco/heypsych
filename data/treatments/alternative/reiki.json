  "summary": "A Japanese energy-healing practice in which practitioners channel universal life energy through light touch or hovering hands to promote relaxation, stress reduction, and self-healing.",
  "description": "Reiki is a biofield-based complementary therapy developed in Japan by Mikao Usui in the early 20th century. It involves a practitioner placing hands lightly on or above the recipient’s body to facilitate the flow of 'universal life energy' (Rei = universal, Ki = vital energy). Reiki is used to support relaxation, reduce stress, relieve pain, and enhance emotional well-being. Scientific explanations remain uncertain; proposed mechanisms include activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, reductions in stress hormones, and modulation of biofield interactions. Reiki is practiced worldwide in wellness, integrative care, and hospital settings, though evidence remains mixed.",
