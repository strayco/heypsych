  "summary": "A mindfulness practice involving systematic attention to sensations throughout the body, used to cultivate awareness, relaxation, and stress reduction.",
  "description": "Body Scan Meditation is a mindfulness-based practice where attention is directed sequentially to different parts of the body, often from head to toe or vice versa. Practitioners observe physical sensations without judgment, fostering greater body awareness, emotional regulation, and relaxation. This technique is a core component of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and is widely used for stress, anxiety, chronic pain, and insomnia. It is generally safe, accessible, and requires no equipment.",
