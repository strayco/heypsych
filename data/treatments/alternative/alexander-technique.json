  "summary": "A mind-body re-education method focused on improving posture, movement, and self-awareness to reduce pain and stress while enhancing coordination and performance.",
  "description": "The Alexander Technique is a therapeutic practice that teaches individuals to become aware of and change habitual patterns of movement, posture, and tension. Developed by F. M. Alexander in the late 19th century, it emphasizes conscious control of movement and alignment. Practitioners use verbal instruction and gentle manual guidance to help clients inhibit maladaptive habits and restore natural coordination. The technique is widely applied for chronic pain management, performance enhancement in musicians and actors, stress reduction, and functional rehabilitation. Clinical research suggests benefits for chronic back and neck pain, balance in older adults, and performance anxiety, though evidence is moderate in scope.",

      "text": "The Alexander Technique emphasizes 'inhibition' (pausing habitual responses) and 'direction' (intentional guidance of movement). By promoting conscious awareness of posture and movement, it reduces unnecessary muscular tension, optimizes alignment, and improves breathing. Neurophysiologically, it engages cortical networks related to body awareness and motor control, potentially altering maladaptive motor patterns. This results in improved efficiency, less pain, and greater resilience in movement."
