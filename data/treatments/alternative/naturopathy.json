  "summary": "A holistic medical system emphasizing lifestyle, nutrition, botanical medicines, and other natural therapies to support the body’s self-healing processes. Scope and regulation vary widely by region.",
  "description": "Naturopathy is a philosophy-driven approach to health care centered on principles such as 'first, do no harm,' treating the whole person, identifying and addressing root causes, and using natural methods to stimulate self-healing. In jurisdictions with licensure, naturopathic doctors (ND/NMD) complete accredited training and may diagnose, order labs, and use a defined therapeutic formulary (e.g., nutrition, botanicals, physical medicine, select pharmaceuticals). In non-licensed regions, practice standards vary. Common modalities include lifestyle counseling, diet/nutrition therapy, botanical medicine, vitamins/minerals, mind–body practices, hydrotherapy, and manual therapies. Evidence for individual modalities ranges from strong (e.g., some nutrition and lifestyle interventions) to limited or mixed (many supplements, detox protocols). Safety depends on practitioner training, product quality, and appropriate integration with conventional care.",
