  "summary": "A rapid, rhythmic yogic breathing technique characterized by forceful exhalations and passive inhalations, often practiced in Kundalini yoga for energy, focus, and detoxification.",
  "description": "Breath of Fire (Kapalabhati in Sanskrit) is a dynamic pranayama technique involving quick, forceful exhalations through the nose powered by abdominal contractions, with passive inhalations in between. It is a core practice in Kundalini yoga and other pranayama traditions, said to cleanse the respiratory system, increase energy, sharpen mental focus, and stimulate digestion. The practice is considered both invigorating and cleansing, often used at the start of yoga sessions or meditation to awaken vitality.",
