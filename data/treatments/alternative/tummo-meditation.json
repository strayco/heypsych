  "summary": "An esoteric Tibetan Buddhist meditative practice involving breath, visualization, and inner heat generation, traditionally used for spiritual development and resilience in extreme cold.",
  "description": "Tummo Meditation, also known as 'Inner Fire' meditation, is a Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhist) tantric practice combining specific breathing patterns, visualization, and concentration techniques to generate inner heat and altered states of consciousness. Practitioners visualize a central channel and inner flame at the navel, which is intensified through vase breathing (forceful breath retention). Traditionally, Tummo is part of advanced spiritual training (Six Yogas of Naropa), intended to cultivate spiritual awakening, bliss, and mastery over bodily processes. Scientific studies on Western adaptations suggest it can influence autonomic nervous system activity, body temperature regulation, and stress resilience, and has been linked to practices such as the Wim Hof Method.",
