  "summary": "A paced yogic breathing (pranayama) practice alternating airflow between nostrils to balance autonomic tone, reduce stress, and improve focus and sleep quality.",
  "description": "Alternate Nostril Breathing—known in yoga as Nadi Shodhana or Anulom Vilom—is a structured breath practice in which one nostril is gently closed while inhaling or exhaling through the other, then sides are switched in a repeating cycle. The technique emphasizes slow, even breaths and mindful attention. Physiologically, it supports parasympathetic activation, heart rate variability (HRV) improvements, reduced perceived stress, and attentional control. It is commonly taught for anxiety reduction, sleep preparation, performance calm, and adjunctive management of mild hypertension and stress-related symptoms.",
