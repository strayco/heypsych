  "description": "Equine-assisted therapy is an umbrella term for structured, goal-directed services involving horses. Mental-health–focused models (often called Equine-Assisted Psychotherapy, EAP) use groundwork and sometimes mounted activities to facilitate insight, emotion regulation, and interpersonal skills. Skill- and recreation-focused programs (therapeutic riding/equestrian activities) aim to build confidence, social skills, and functional abilities. In rehabilitation, hippotherapy is a clinical treatment in which physical, occupational, or speech therapists use the horse’s movement as part of a plan of care to influence posture, balance, sensorimotor processing, and communication. Evidence suggests benefits for balance and gross motor function in select neurologic conditions (especially children with cerebral palsy) and promising—though mixed—findings for PTSD, anxiety, and autism spectrum–related outcomes.",
