  "summary": "A therapeutic approach designed to help individuals, especially children with sensory processing difficulties, organize and respond appropriately to sensory input through play-based activities.",
  "description": "Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT), developed by occupational therapist A. Jean Ayres in the 1970s, is a structured, play-based intervention aimed at improving the brain’s ability to process and integrate sensory information (touch, movement, sound, vision, body awareness). It is most commonly used for children with sensory processing disorder, autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and developmental challenges. Therapy sessions are tailored to provide sensory-rich activities that challenge the individual to respond adaptively, enhancing motor skills, self-regulation, and functional participation. Evidence for SIT is mixed, with some supportive studies but also critiques of methodological limitations.",
