  "summary": "A modern variation of traditional acupuncture that applies mild electrical currents to needles inserted at acupuncture points, enhancing therapeutic effects.",
  "description": "Electroacupuncture is an adaptation of traditional acupuncture in which fine needles are inserted at specific points on the body and then connected to a device that delivers continuous, mild electrical pulses. The technique is believed to augment the effects of manual acupuncture by providing stronger and more consistent stimulation. Electroacupuncture is used to address pain, inflammation, neurological disorders, and other conditions, and is commonly applied in both integrative medicine and clinical research settings.",
