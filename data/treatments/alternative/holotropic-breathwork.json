  "summary": "A therapeutic practice combining accelerated breathing, evocative music, and focused bodywork in a group setting to induce non-ordinary states of consciousness for psychological healing, self-discovery, and spiritual growth.",
  "description": "Holotropic Breathwork, developed by Stanislav and Christina Grof in the 1970s, is a psychospiritual technique intended to access non-ordinary states of consciousness for healing, emotional release, and personal insight. The practice involves extended periods of accelerated breathing (similar to hyperventilation), accompanied by evocative music and bodywork to facilitate somatic release. Sessions are often conducted in groups with facilitators and 'sitters' for safety. Although many participants report catharsis, expanded awareness, and relief of psychological distress, scientific evidence for its efficacy remains limited, and safety concerns exist regarding cardiovascular and psychiatric risks.",
