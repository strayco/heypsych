  "summary": "A simple, structured breathing technique involving equal phases of inhalation, breath-holding, exhalation, and holding, commonly used to reduce stress and enhance focus.",
  "description": "Box Breathing, also known as square breathing, is a controlled breathing technique that follows a four-part cycle: inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Each phase typically lasts four counts, forming a balanced 'box' pattern. This practice is used to calm the nervous system, improve concentration, and regulate stress. It has been adopted by athletes, military personnel, and individuals managing anxiety. It is easy to learn, requires no equipment, and can be practiced anywhere.",
