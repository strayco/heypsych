  "description": "Drama therapy is a psychotherapeutic approach that integrates theater methods such as role play, improvisation, storytelling, performance, and expressive movement. It provides a safe and structured environment for individuals to explore personal experiences, express emotions, and rehearse new behaviors. It is used with individuals, groups, and communities, often addressing mental health issues, trauma, social challenges, or developmental concerns. By engaging in symbolic play and performance, clients can externalize internal struggles, gain new perspectives, and develop coping strategies.",
