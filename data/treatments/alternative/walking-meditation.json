  "summary": "A mindfulness practice that combines movement and breath awareness by focusing attention on each step, fostering presence, calm, and emotional regulation.",
  "description": "Walking Meditation is a contemplative practice found in Buddhist traditions (notably Zen and Theravāda) and modern mindfulness approaches. Instead of seated stillness, practitioners cultivate awareness by synchronizing breath and focused attention with slow, deliberate steps. Often integrated into retreats, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), or daily practice, walking meditation enhances present-moment awareness, body-mind connection, and emotional grounding. Benefits include stress reduction, improved mood, and enhanced focus. It is accessible to most individuals and adaptable for those who may find seated meditation challenging.",
