  "summary": "A mental health intervention that uses creative art-making within a therapeutic relationship to foster expression, regulation, insight, and behavioral change.",
  "description": "Art therapy integrates psychotherapeutic approaches with visual art media (e.g., drawing, painting, collage, sculpture). Guided by a trained art therapist, clients externalize experiences symbolically, build emotion-regulation skills, and develop new narratives. Modalities range from nondirective, client-led expression to structured, goal-oriented protocols for trauma, mood disorders, medical coping, and rehabilitation. Evidence supports benefits for anxiety, depression, trauma-related symptoms, and quality of life in medical and behavioral health settings; rigor and outcomes vary by population and method.",
