  "summary": "A manual therapy technique focused on identifying and releasing myofascial trigger points—tight, hypersensitive spots in muscle tissue that can cause localized or referred pain.",
  "description": "Trigger Point Therapy is a hands-on manual technique aimed at relieving pain and dysfunction caused by myofascial trigger points—taut bands of skeletal muscle fibers that are tender to touch and can refer pain to distant body regions. Practitioners apply sustained pressure, ischemic compression, massage, or needling techniques to deactivate trigger points, restore muscle length, and improve mobility. The therapy is often used for chronic musculoskeletal pain, tension headaches, fibromyalgia, and sports-related injuries. It can be performed by massage therapists, physical therapists, chiropractors, or physicians, and may be combined with stretching, exercise, or dry needling. Evidence suggests effectiveness for localized muscle pain, though high-quality research is mixed.",
