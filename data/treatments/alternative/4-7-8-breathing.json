  "name": "4-7-8 Breathing",
  "summary": "A paced breathing exercise popularized by Dr. Andrew Weil that involves inhaling for 4 seconds, holding for 7, and exhaling for 8. Used to reduce anxiety, improve sleep, and regulate stress responses via parasympathetic activation.",
  "description": "The 4-7-8 breathing technique is a structured breath-control practice derived from pranayama (yogic breathing). It emphasizes a specific pattern: inhale quietly through the nose for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 7 seconds, then exhale audibly through the mouth for 8 seconds. The method promotes vagal activation, reduces sympathetic arousal, and supports autonomic balance. It is widely recommended as a relaxation tool for stress, insomnia, and anxiety, and can be integrated into mindfulness, yoga, or cognitive behavioral strategies. Evidence suggests benefits in lowering heart rate, reducing perceived stress, and improving sleep onset.",

The breath-holding phase (7 seconds) may increase CO2 retention transiently, which can deepen relaxation and slow heart rate. This promotes vagal tone, stabilizes heart rate variability (HRV), and supports stress resilience. Psychologically, the structured pattern fosters mindful attention and grounding."
