  "summary": "A therapeutic approach to hypnosis developed by Milton H. Erickson that uses indirect suggestion, metaphor, and storytelling to help clients access unconscious resources for change.",
  "description": "Ericksonian hypnosis is a form of therapeutic hypnosis pioneered by psychiatrist Milton H. Erickson. Unlike traditional, directive hypnosis, Ericksonian methods are characterized by indirect suggestions, metaphors, stories, and conversational techniques designed to bypass resistance and engage the unconscious mind. Sessions are often individualized, flexible, and client-centered, focusing on naturalistic communication rather than rigid induction scripts. Practitioners may integrate Ericksonian techniques into psychotherapy for issues such as anxiety, pain management, habit change, and trauma recovery. While clinical research on hypnosis is moderately supportive for certain applications, specific evidence for Ericksonian methods is less robust, with most support coming from case studies and experiential reports.",
