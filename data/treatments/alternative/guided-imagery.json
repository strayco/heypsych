  "summary": "A relaxation and mind–body technique that uses visualization and sensory imagination to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and improve emotional and physical well-being.",
  "description": "Guided imagery is a mind–body practice in which an individual is directed to imagine calming scenes, experiences, or sensations to promote relaxation and well-being. A practitioner, recording, or self-practice script guides the process, often using metaphors, visualizations, and multi-sensory cues (sight, sound, touch, smell) to elicit desired psychological and physiological responses. It is used for stress management, pain control, anxiety reduction, and preparation for medical procedures. By engaging imagination, guided imagery can influence autonomic nervous system regulation, reduce sympathetic arousal, and enhance a sense of safety and calm.",
