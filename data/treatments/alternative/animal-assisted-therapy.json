  "summary": "A therapeutic approach that incorporates trained animals into treatment sessions to promote emotional, cognitive, and physical health benefits in a structured clinical framework.",
  "description": "Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) integrates animals—such as dogs, horses, cats, or small mammals—into formal treatment sessions led by a licensed therapist or healthcare provider. Unlike casual animal interactions, AAT is goal-directed, individualized, and evidence-informed. It leverages the human–animal bond to reduce stress, facilitate emotional expression, improve social interaction, and support rehabilitation. Variants include equine-assisted therapy, canine-assisted therapy, and animal-assisted psychotherapy. Evidence suggests benefits for anxiety, depression, PTSD, autism spectrum disorders, rehabilitation outcomes, and social functioning, though quality and scope of research vary.",
