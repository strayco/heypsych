  "description": "Ayurvedic herbs form a central component of Ayurveda, one of the world’s oldest holistic medical systems. Plants are prescribed individually or in multi-herb formulas to balance Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Common examples include Ashwagandha (stress and sleep), Triphalā (digestion and bowel health), Turmeric (inflammation), Tulsi/Holy Basil (respiratory and immune health), and Guggul (lipid and joint support). Formulations may come as powders, decoctions, tablets, ghee/oil preparations, or topical pastes. Evidence ranges from promising (e.g., ashwagandha for anxiety and sleep, turmeric for arthritis) to limited or anecdotal. Quality control is critical due to risks of adulteration or heavy metal contamination.",
