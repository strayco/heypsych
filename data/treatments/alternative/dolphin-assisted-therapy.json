  "summary": "A controversial form of animal-assisted therapy that involves interaction with dolphins for perceived physical, psychological, or developmental benefits.",
  "description": "Dolphin-Assisted Therapy (DAT) is a type of animal-assisted intervention where participants interact with dolphins in controlled settings, often in captivity. Proponents claim it enhances physical rehabilitation, improves mood, and aids individuals with developmental or psychological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, depression, or PTSD. The therapy typically involves swimming, playing, or guided exercises with dolphins under professional supervision. Critics highlight ethical concerns, lack of rigorous evidence for effectiveness, and potential harm to both dolphins and humans.",
