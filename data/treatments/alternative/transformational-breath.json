  "summary": "A conscious breathing technique designed to integrate suppressed emotions, release tension, and enhance physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.",
  "description": "Transformational Breath is a self-empowering breathing practice developed by Dr. Judith Kravitz that uses a connected (continuous, circular) breath pattern to promote physical vitality, emotional integration, and expanded states of consciousness. The method incorporates conscious connected breathing, sound, movement, and gentle bodywork or affirmations. It is often practiced in individual sessions, workshops, or group retreats, and is intended to release held trauma and stress, improve energy flow, and support spiritual growth. Reported benefits include improved respiratory function, stress reduction, emotional healing, and enhanced self-awareness. While research is limited, anecdotal and observational reports suggest meaningful outcomes in well-being and resilience.",
