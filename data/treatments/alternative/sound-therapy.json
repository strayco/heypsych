  "summary": "A broad range of therapeutic practices using sound, music, and vibration to promote relaxation, emotional balance, and healing effects on the mind and body.",
  "description": "Sound therapy encompasses a wide range of practices that use sound and vibration for therapeutic purposes, including tuning forks, gongs, singing bowls, binaural beats, and music-based interventions. These methods are believed to influence brainwave states, nervous system activity, and emotional well-being. Modern applications include stress reduction, sleep improvement, pain management, and supportive care in mental health and chronic illness. While traditional forms often draw from spiritual or cultural practices (e.g., Tibetan bowls, Aboriginal didgeridoo healing), clinical adaptations focus on evidence-based uses such as music therapy and vibroacoustic therapy. Research is emerging but suggests benefits for stress, anxiety, pain, and quality of life.",
