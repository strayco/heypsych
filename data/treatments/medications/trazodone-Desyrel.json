  "summary": "Trazodone is an antidepressant often used to treat major depressive disorder, insomnia, and certain anxiety disorders.",
  "description": "Trazodone, marketed under the brand name Desyrel among others, is an antidepressant that acts primarily as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI). It is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults, but is also widely prescribed off-label for insomnia and anxiety due to its sedative properties. Trazodone modulates serotonin activity in the brain and has additional alpha-adrenergic and histamine receptor blocking effects. Its sedative action is thought to be related to its antihistaminic and alpha-1 adrenergic blocking properties.",
