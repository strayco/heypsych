  "summary": "Quetiapine, marketed as Seroquel, is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and as an adjunct for major depressive disorder. It has sedative, mood-stabilizing, and antipsychotic effects.",
  "description": "Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic that exerts its effects primarily through antagonism at serotonin 5-HT2A and dopamine D2 receptors, with additional action on histamine H1 and adrenergic α1 and α2 receptors. It is available in both immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (XR) formulations. In addition to its FDA-approved uses for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, it is sometimes prescribed off-label for anxiety disorders and insomnia, though caution is advised due to side effects and dependency risk.",
