  "summary": "A wakefulness-promoting medication used to treat excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder.",
  "description": "Armodafinil is the R-enantiomer of modafinil, with a longer half-life and potentially more sustained wakefulness-promoting effects. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness due to narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and shift work sleep disorder (SWSD). Its exact mechanism is unclear but is thought to involve modulation of dopaminergic signaling via dopamine transporter inhibition.",
