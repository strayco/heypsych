  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with additional off-label uses for treatment-resistant depression and other psychiatric conditions.",
  "description": "Olanzapine is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic that works by antagonizing dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, among others. It is effective in reducing psychotic symptoms, stabilizing mood, and managing acute manic episodes. Compared to first-generation antipsychotics, it has a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms but is associated with significant metabolic side effects.",
