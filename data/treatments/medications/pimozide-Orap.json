  "summary": "Pimozide is a typical antipsychotic of the diphenylbutylpiperidine class, primarily used for managing Tourette's disorder and chronic psychotic disorders when other treatments are not effective or tolerated.",
  "description": "Pimozide is a long-acting dopamine receptor antagonist, particularly at D2 receptors, which reduces dopaminergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. It is mainly indicated for suppressing motor and phonic tics in Tourette's disorder and may also be used for schizophrenia or delusional disorders. Due to potential cardiac risks, pimozide use requires careful ECG monitoring and dose adjustments.",
