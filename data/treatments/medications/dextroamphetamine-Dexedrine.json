  "description": "Dextroamphetamine is the dextrorotatory isomer of amphetamine, with strong CNS stimulant properties. It increases synaptic concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine by promoting their release and inhibiting reuptake. Dextroamphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It has a high potential for abuse and dependence.",
