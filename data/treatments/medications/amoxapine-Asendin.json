  "summary": "A tetracyclic antidepressant with combined norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibition, as well as dopamine receptor antagonism.",
  "description": "Amoxapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant structurally related to dibenzoxazepines. It inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin and also has dopamine receptor antagonist activity, giving it some antipsychotic properties. It was formerly marketed under the brand name Asendin for depression, especially with associated anxiety or psychotic features. Its use has declined due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia and the availability of newer, safer antidepressants.",
