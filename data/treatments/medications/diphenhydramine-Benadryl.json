  "description": "Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1 receptor antagonist with anticholinergic and sedative properties. It is commonly used for allergic reactions, hay fever, the common cold, and short-term management of insomnia. It can also be used for motion sickness prevention, extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) management, and mild anxiety. Due to strong sedation and anticholinergic effects, it is not generally recommended for chronic use in older adults.",
