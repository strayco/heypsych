  "summary": "Propranolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker used in the treatment of hypertension, angina, arrhythmias, migraine prophylaxis, and certain anxiety disorders.",
  "description": "Propranolol, marketed under the brand name Inderal and others, is a first-generation non-selective beta-blocker that blocks both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. This action reduces heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output, and also dampens the physiological effects of adrenaline, which can be useful in cardiovascular and anxiety-related conditions. Beyond cardiovascular indications, propranolol is also used for migraine prophylaxis, essential tremor, and management of physical symptoms of anxiety such as performance anxiety.",
