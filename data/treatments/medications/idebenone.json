  "description": "Idebenone is a short-chain synthetic benzoquinone and an analog of coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone). It acts as an antioxidant and electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It has been studied for various neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and other mitochondrial disorders, though psychiatric uses are mostly experimental.",
