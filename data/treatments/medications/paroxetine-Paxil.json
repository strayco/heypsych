  "description": "Paroxetine, marketed under the brand name Paxil among others, is an SSRI antidepressant that increases serotonin levels in the brain by inhibiting its reuptake into neurons. It is prescribed for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It has a relatively short half-life compared to some other SSRIs, which can lead to withdrawal symptoms if discontinued abruptly.",
