  "description": "Fluphenazine is a high-potency typical antipsychotic of the phenothiazine class. It acts primarily as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, reducing positive symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinations and delusions. Available in oral, short-acting injectable, and long-acting decanoate forms, it is used for both acute symptom control and long-term maintenance therapy in schizophrenia.",
