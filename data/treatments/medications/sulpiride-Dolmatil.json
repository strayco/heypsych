  "summary": "Sulpiride (Dolmatil) is a benzamide antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia, depressive disorders, and certain gastrointestinal conditions.",
  "description": "Sulpiride, sold under brand names including Dolmatil and Dogmatil, is a substituted benzamide antipsychotic that selectively antagonizes dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. At higher doses, it is used in the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, while at lower doses it may be prescribed for depression, dysthymia, and functional dyspepsia. It is also sometimes used to treat vertigo. Sulpiride is not approved in the United States but is widely used in Europe, Asia, and South America.",
