  "description": "Chlordiazepoxide, marketed as Librium, is a long-acting benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, sedative, and muscle relaxant properties. It was the first benzodiazepine introduced into clinical practice and is still used today, particularly for managing alcohol withdrawal syndrome due to its long half-life and smoother withdrawal profile. It enhances the effects of GABA at the GABA-A receptor, leading to central nervous system depression.",
