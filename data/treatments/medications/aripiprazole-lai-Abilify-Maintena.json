  "description": "Abilify Maintena is a long-acting injectable (LAI) formulation of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic. It delivers sustained aripiprazole plasma levels for approximately one month, improving adherence in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. Its mechanism of action involves partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.",
