  "summary": "A dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance.",
  "description": "Daridorexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that promotes sleep by inhibiting the wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and B from binding to their receptors (OX1R and OX2R). Unlike benzodiazepines or Z-drugs, daridorexant does not act on GABA receptors and is thought to have a lower risk of dependence. It is indicated for adults with insomnia and is designed to help with both sleep onset and sleep maintenance while minimizing next-day sedation.",
