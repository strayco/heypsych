  "summary": "Sertraline (Zoloft) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, and other mood-related conditions.",
  "description": "Sertraline, marketed under the brand name Zoloft, is an SSRI antidepressant that increases synaptic serotonin levels by inhibiting its reuptake into presynaptic neurons. It is FDA-approved for major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). It is generally well-tolerated but may cause gastrointestinal upset, sexual dysfunction, and insomnia. Abrupt discontinuation can result in withdrawal symptoms, so tapering is recommended when stopping therapy.",
