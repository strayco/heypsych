  "summary": "Quazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine primarily prescribed for the treatment of insomnia, especially when difficulty falling or staying asleep is persistent.",
  "description": "Quazepam, marketed under the brand name Doral, is a benzodiazepine hypnotic with a relatively long half-life. It enhances the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, resulting in sedation, muscle relaxation, and anxiolysis. It is generally used for short-term management of insomnia, particularly in patients requiring prolonged sleep maintenance.",
