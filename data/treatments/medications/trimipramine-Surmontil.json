  "summary": "Trimipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant used to treat depression, with sedative properties that may also benefit patients with insomnia.",
  "description": "Trimipramine, marketed under the brand name Surmontil, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with strong sedative and anxiolytic effects. Unlike many TCAs, its antidepressant activity may be partly independent of classic monoamine reuptake inhibition. It is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder and may also be prescribed off-label for insomnia, especially in depressed patients. Trimipramine has strong histamine H1 receptor antagonism and alpha-adrenergic blocking properties, contributing to its sedative effects and side effect profile.",
