  "description": "Paliperidone palmitate (Invega Sustenna) is the once-monthly formulation of paliperidone, an atypical antipsychotic. It is the palmitate ester prodrug of paliperidone, which is the active metabolite of risperidone. Invega Sustenna provides sustained therapeutic plasma levels with monthly intramuscular injections, supporting adherence and long-term symptom control in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The drug exerts its effect primarily through antagonism of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.",
