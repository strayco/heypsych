  "description": "Nefazodone is an antidepressant that works as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI). It is effective in major depressive disorder and some anxiety disorders but is rarely used today due to its association with life-threatening hepatic failure. It is structurally related to trazodone but has less sedative and sexual side effects.",
