  "summary": "Selegiline (Eldepryl) is a selective MAO-B inhibitor used to treat Parkinson's disease and major depressive disorder.",
  "description": "Selegiline, marketed under brand names including Eldepryl and Zelapar, is a selective, irreversible monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor. At recommended doses, it reduces dopamine breakdown in the brain, thereby enhancing dopaminergic activity. It is indicated as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa in Parkinson's disease to reduce 'wearing-off' symptoms, and in transdermal form for the treatment of major depressive disorder. At higher doses, it loses selectivity and inhibits MAO-A as well, increasing the risk of dietary tyramine interactions.",
