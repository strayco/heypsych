  "description": "Thiopental sodium, marketed under the brand name Pentothal, is an ultra–short-acting barbiturate that enhances the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor. It is used primarily for the induction of general anesthesia, procedural sedation, and rapid control of seizures in emergency situations. Its effects occur within seconds after intravenous administration but last only a few minutes due to rapid redistribution from the brain to peripheral tissues. Thiopental is a controlled substance (Schedule III in the U.S.) and has been largely replaced in many clinical settings by newer agents such as propofol.",
