  "summary": "A short-acting SSRI approved in some countries for the treatment of premature ejaculation.",
  "description": "Dapoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) developed specifically for on-demand use in premature ejaculation (PE). Unlike other SSRIs used daily for depression or anxiety, dapoxetine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated, allowing for dosing 1–3 hours before sexual activity. It is not approved for depression due to its short half-life.",
