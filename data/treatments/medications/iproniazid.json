  "description": "Iproniazid was one of the first antidepressants discovered, initially developed for tuberculosis. It was found to have mood-elevating properties, leading to its use as an antidepressant in the 1950s. As a non-selective, irreversible MAOI, it increases synaptic levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Due to high hepatotoxicity risk, it has been withdrawn from most markets.",
