  "description": "Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) that inhibits norepinephrine reuptake with minimal effects on serotonin reuptake. It also exhibits antihistaminic and anticholinergic properties. It has been used for major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and depressive episodes with anxiety. Due to its risk of seizures and availability of safer alternatives, it is less commonly prescribed today.",
