  "summary": "An anticonvulsant approved for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, sometimes used off-label in psychiatry for mood stabilization.",
  "description": "Brivaracetam is a high-affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) ligand, structurally related to levetiracetam. It is primarily indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. Some emerging evidence suggests possible off-label uses in mood disorders, anxiety, and behavioral dysregulation, although this is not standard practice. Compared to levetiracetam, brivaracetam may have a lower incidence of behavioral side effects.",
