  "summary": "A long-acting benzodiazepine used for seizure disorders, panic disorder, and certain movement disorders.",
  "description": "Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant properties. It works by enhancing the effects of GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, leading to increased neuronal inhibition. Due to its long half-life, clonazepam is often preferred for sustained control of seizures or panic attacks but carries a risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms with prolonged use.",
