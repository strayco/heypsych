  "description": "Valproate semisodium, marketed under various brand names including Depakote, is a coordination compound of sodium valproate and valproic acid in a 1:1 ratio. It is widely used for the treatment of epilepsy (various seizure types), acute manic or mixed episodes in bipolar disorder, and migraine prophylaxis. Its mechanisms include increasing brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, modulating voltage-gated sodium channels, and inhibiting T-type calcium channels. The semisodium form is designed to improve gastrointestinal tolerability compared to valproic acid.",
