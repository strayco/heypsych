  "description": "Protriptyline, sold under the brand name Vivactil, is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its stimulating properties compared to other TCAs. It works by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and, to a lesser extent, serotonin, increasing their levels in the synaptic cleft. Due to its activating profile, it is sometimes used in patients with depressive symptoms who experience significant fatigue or lethargy.",
