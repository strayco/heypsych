  "description": "Cannabidiol (Epidiolex) is a prescription formulation of highly purified cannabidiol derived from the cannabis plant. It is FDA-approved for seizures associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex. Unlike THC, CBD is non-intoxicating. It modulates multiple molecular targets, including cannabinoid receptors, TRP channels, and serotonin receptors, contributing to its anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Research is ongoing into its potential role in anxiety, psychosis, and neurodegenerative diseases.",
