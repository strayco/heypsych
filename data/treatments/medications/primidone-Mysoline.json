  "summary": "Primidone is an anticonvulsant used to treat various seizure disorders and essential tremor. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.",
  "description": "Primidone, marketed under the brand name Mysoline, is a barbiturate-derived anticonvulsant. It is structurally related to phenobarbital and is metabolized into phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA), both of which contribute to its antiepileptic effects. Primidone is effective in controlling tonic-clonic (grand mal), complex partial (psychomotor), and focal seizures, as well as essential tremor. It is taken orally and has a slow onset of action but provides long-lasting seizure control.",
