  "summary": "Vigabatrin is an antiepileptic medication used for infantile spasms and refractory complex partial seizures.",
  "description": "Vigabatrin, marketed under the brand name Sabril, is an irreversible inhibitor of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase, leading to increased levels of GABA in the brain and reduced neuronal excitability. It is primarily indicated for infantile spasms in patients 1 month to 2 years old and as adjunctive therapy for refractory complex partial seizures in adults and children. Due to the risk of permanent vision loss, its use is restricted under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program.",
