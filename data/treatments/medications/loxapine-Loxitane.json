  "summary": "A typical antipsychotic used primarily for the treatment of schizophrenia and sometimes bipolar disorder.",
  "description": "Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine typical antipsychotic with pharmacological properties that overlap with both first- and second-generation agents. It primarily antagonizes dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, providing antipsychotic effects. Loxapine is available in oral, intramuscular, and inhalation forms (the latter as Adasuve). The oral and IM forms are indicated mainly for schizophrenia, while the inhalation form is used for rapid control of acute agitation.",
