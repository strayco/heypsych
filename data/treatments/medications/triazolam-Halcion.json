  "summary": "Triazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine used for the short-term treatment of insomnia.",
  "description": "Triazolam, marketed under the brand name Halcion, is a short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic used primarily for the short-term management of insomnia, especially difficulties with sleep initiation. It enhances the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor, leading to sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects. Due to its short half-life, triazolam is best suited for people who have trouble falling asleep rather than staying asleep. It is generally prescribed for no longer than 7–10 days to minimize risks of dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal.",
