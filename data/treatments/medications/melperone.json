  "summary": "A typical antipsychotic of the butyrophenone class used mainly in Europe for schizophrenia, agitation, and sleep disturbances, especially in the elderly.",
  "description": "Melperone is a low-potency typical antipsychotic structurally related to haloperidol but with markedly lower D2 receptor affinity, leading to a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. It also has sedative and anxiolytic properties due to antagonism at serotonergic and histaminergic receptors. It is used in the treatment of schizophrenia, behavioral disturbances in dementia, and as a sedative in psychiatric settings. It is not approved in the United States.",
