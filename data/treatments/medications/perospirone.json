  "summary": "Perospirone is an atypical antipsychotic used primarily for the treatment of schizophrenia and, in some cases, bipolar disorder.",
  "description": "Perospirone is a serotonin-dopamine antagonist (SDA) with high affinity for 5-HT2A and dopamine D2 receptors, offering antipsychotic effects with a potentially lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms than typical antipsychotics. It is approved for schizophrenia treatment in Japan and some other countries but is not widely available globally. Its pharmacological profile also includes partial agonist activity at 5-HT1A receptors, which may contribute to its anxiolytic and antidepressant effects.",
