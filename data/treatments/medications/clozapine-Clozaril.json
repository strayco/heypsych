  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic reserved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and reduction of suicidal behavior in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.",
  "description": "Clozapine is an atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic with unique efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. It has a broad receptor profile, antagonizing dopamine D4 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors among others. It is the only antipsychotic shown to reduce suicidal behavior in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Due to the risk of severe agranulocytosis, myocarditis, and seizures, it requires strict monitoring of blood counts and is dispensed under specialized REMS programs in some countries.",
