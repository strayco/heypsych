  "description": "Clobazam is a long-acting 1,5-benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative effects. Unlike most benzodiazepines, which are 1,4-benzodiazepines, clobazam’s chemical structure gives it a slightly different receptor-binding profile, often with less sedation relative to its anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects. It is FDA-approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged 2 years and older, but it is also used off-label for anxiety disorders and other seizure types.",
