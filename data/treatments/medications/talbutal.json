  "summary": "Talbutal is a barbiturate previously used as a sedative-hypnotic for insomnia and as a pre-anesthetic, now rarely used due to safety concerns and availability of safer alternatives.",
  "description": "Talbutal is a short- to intermediate-acting barbiturate that was once prescribed for the short-term treatment of insomnia and for pre-anesthetic sedation. Like other barbiturates, it works by enhancing the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA at the GABA-A receptor, leading to CNS depression. Due to its high potential for dependence, overdose risk, and the development of tolerance, Talbutal use has largely been replaced by safer medications such as benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. It is classified as a Schedule III controlled substance in the U.S., though it is rarely prescribed today.",
