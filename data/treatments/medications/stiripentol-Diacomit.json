  "summary": "Stiripentol (Diacomit) is an anticonvulsant used as adjunctive therapy for seizures in Dravet syndrome.",
  "description": "Stiripentol, marketed under the brand name Diacomit, is an oral anticonvulsant approved for use in combination with clobazam to treat seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older who are taking clobazam. Its mechanism of action is not fully understood but is believed to involve enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission and inhibition of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, which increases plasma levels of co-administered antiepileptic drugs. Stiripentol is typically used when seizures are not adequately controlled by other medications.",
