  "description": "Topiramate, marketed under the brand name Topamax, is an anticonvulsant medication with multiple mechanisms of action. It is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy, either as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, and for migraine prophylaxis in adults and adolescents. Topiramate modulates voltage-gated sodium channels, enhances GABA-A receptor activity, antagonizes AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors, and inhibits carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes. It is also used off-label for mood stabilization, weight management, and treatment of certain addictive disorders.",
