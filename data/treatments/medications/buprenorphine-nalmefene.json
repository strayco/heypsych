  "summary": "A combination of a partial opioid agonist and an opioid antagonist investigated for the treatment of opioid use disorder.",
  "description": "Buprenorphine/nalmefene is a combination medication pairing buprenorphine, a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor with high binding affinity, and nalmefene, a long-acting opioid antagonist. This combination is designed to reduce misuse potential while maintaining efficacy in opioid dependence treatment. Nalmefene’s longer half-life compared to naloxone may provide extended blockade of opioid effects, but the formulation remains experimental or limited to specific regions.",
