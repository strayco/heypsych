  "description": "Hexobarbital is a short-acting barbiturate that depresses the central nervous system through potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission. It was historically used for induction of anesthesia, sedation, and treatment of insomnia, but is rarely used today due to safety concerns, high abuse potential, and the availability of safer alternatives.",
