  "summary": "A nasal spray NMDA receptor antagonist approved for treatment-resistant depression and depressive symptoms in adults with acute suicidal ideation or behavior.",
  "description": "Esketamine is the S-enantiomer of ketamine and acts as a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. It is approved for use in combination with an oral antidepressant for adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and for depressive symptoms in adults with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. Esketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects, often within hours, and must be administered in a certified healthcare setting due to safety concerns, including potential for dissociation, sedation, and blood pressure increases.",
