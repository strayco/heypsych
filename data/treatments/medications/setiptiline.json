  "summary": "Setiptiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant used in Japan for the treatment of depression and depressive symptoms.",
  "description": "Setiptiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) structurally related to mirtazapine, marketed in Japan under the brand name Tecipul. It is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder and related depressive states. Setiptiline acts primarily as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), antagonizing central presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors to increase norepinephrine and serotonin release, while also blocking specific serotonin receptors (5-HT2, 5-HT3) and histamine H1 receptors. It is not approved in the United States or Europe.",
