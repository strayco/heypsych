  "description": "Milnacipran is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that increases levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, improving pain modulation and mood. While it is approved in the U.S. specifically for fibromyalgia, it is used in other countries as an antidepressant for major depressive disorder. It is generally well tolerated but may cause side effects such as nausea, headache, constipation, and insomnia.",
