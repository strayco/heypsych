  "summary": "A GABA-B receptor agonist primarily used for spasticity but also studied and used off-label for alcohol use disorder, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions.",
  "description": "Baclofen is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that works as a GABA-B receptor agonist. While it is FDA-approved for spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, it has been increasingly used off-label in psychiatry, particularly for alcohol use disorder and, in some cases, anxiety disorders. Baclofen may reduce craving and anxiety through modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission. It is generally well tolerated but can cause sedation and dizziness, especially during titration.",
