  "summary": "A wakefulness-promoting medication used for narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder; sometimes used off-label for cognitive enhancement and fatigue.",
  "description": "Modafinil is a non-amphetamine central nervous system stimulant that promotes wakefulness. Its precise mechanism is not fully understood but is thought to involve inhibition of dopamine reuptake, modulation of orexin, histamine, and other neurotransmitter systems. It has lower abuse potential compared to traditional stimulants and is generally well tolerated.",
