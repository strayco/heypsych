  "summary": "Prazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative primarily used for the treatment of anxiety disorders. It has a long half-life and is metabolized to desmethyldiazepam, which contributes to its prolonged effects.",
  "description": "Prazepam is an anxiolytic medication belonging to the benzodiazepine class. It is indicated for the short-term treatment of anxiety disorders and symptoms. Compared to some other benzodiazepines, prazepam is less sedating initially but produces a sustained calming effect due to its active metabolite. It is generally reserved for cases where a long duration of action is beneficial. Prazepam is not widely available in the United States but is prescribed in certain European and other countries.",
