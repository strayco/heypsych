  "description": "Molindone is a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic belonging to the dihydroindolone class. It has dopamine D2 receptor antagonist activity and is indicated for the management of schizophrenia. It is less commonly associated with weight gain compared to many other antipsychotics but may cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and other typical antipsychotic side effects. Moban was discontinued in the U.S. for commercial reasons, not due to safety concerns.",
