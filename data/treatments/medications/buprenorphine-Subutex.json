  "summary": "A partial opioid agonist used for maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder, particularly in settings where naloxone is not required or not tolerated.",
  "description": "Subutex contains buprenorphine alone, without naloxone. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor, which suppresses withdrawal symptoms and reduces cravings while having a ceiling effect on respiratory depression. Subutex is often used in special populations, such as during pregnancy, or in patients who cannot tolerate naloxone. It can be misused if injected, which is why combination formulations are more commonly used in many countries.",
