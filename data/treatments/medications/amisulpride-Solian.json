  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used primarily for schizophrenia and, in some regions, for dysthymia at low doses.",
  "description": "Amisulpride is a substituted benzamide atypical antipsychotic that selectively antagonizes dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. At higher doses, it is effective for positive symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking postsynaptic receptors; at lower doses, it preferentially blocks presynaptic receptors, enhancing dopamine release and improving negative symptoms and dysthymia. It is not approved in the United States but is widely used in parts of Europe, Australia, and other countries.",
