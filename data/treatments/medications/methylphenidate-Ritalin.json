  "summary": "A short-acting central nervous system stimulant used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.",
  "description": "Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is a CNS stimulant that increases dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain by blocking their reuptake into presynaptic neurons. It is indicated for ADHD in children and adults and narcolepsy in adults. Ritalin is an immediate-release formulation, usually dosed multiple times per day due to its short duration of action.",
