  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.",
  "description": "Cariprazine (Vraylar) is an atypical antipsychotic that acts as a dopamine D3/D2 receptor partial agonist with a preference for D3 receptors, and as a serotonin 5-HT1A partial agonist and 5-HT2A antagonist. It is FDA-approved for schizophrenia, manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, bipolar depression, and as an adjunct to antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD). Its long half-life and active metabolites allow for once-daily dosing but also mean slower changes in steady-state concentrations.",
