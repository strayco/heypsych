  "description": "Guanfacine is a centrally acting alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist that reduces sympathetic nerve impulses, leading to decreased blood pressure and improved impulse control. In psychiatry, the ER formulation (Intuniv) is FDA-approved for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents, while the IR formulation (Tenex) is used off-label for ADHD, anxiety, and withdrawal syndromes.",
