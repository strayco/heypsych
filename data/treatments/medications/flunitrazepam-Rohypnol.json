  "summary": "A potent long-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic, formerly used for severe insomnia but now tightly controlled or banned in many countries.",
  "description": "Flunitrazepam is a high-potency benzodiazepine with strong hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant properties. It has a long elimination half-life, making it effective for sleep induction and maintenance. Due to its amnesic effects and history of misuse, including as a 'date rape' drug, Rohypnol is heavily regulated and not approved for use in the United States. It is still prescribed in some countries for severe, refractory insomnia or as a pre-anesthetic medication.",
