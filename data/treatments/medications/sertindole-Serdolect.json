  "description": "Sertindole, marketed under the brand name Serdolect, is an oral atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. It exhibits antagonistic activity at dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Sertindole is associated with QT interval prolongation and has been withdrawn or restricted in some countries due to increased risk of sudden cardiac death. It is generally reserved for patients who have not responded to or tolerated other antipsychotics, and use requires cardiac monitoring.",
