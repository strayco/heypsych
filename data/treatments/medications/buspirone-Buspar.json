  "summary": "An anxiolytic primarily used for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), distinct from benzodiazepines in its mechanism and side effect profile.",
  "description": "Buspirone is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that functions as a serotonin 5-HT1A partial agonist with some dopamine D2 receptor affinity. It is indicated for generalized anxiety disorder and is valued for its non-sedating, non-habit-forming properties. Buspirone does not provide immediate relief and is ineffective for acute anxiety episodes, but is effective in chronic anxiety management.",
