  "summary": "A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used for depression, anxiety disorders, and other mental health conditions.",
  "description": "Fluoxetine is an SSRI that increases serotonin levels in the brain by inhibiting its reuptake into presynaptic neurons. It is FDA-approved for major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, bulimia nervosa, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Fluoxetine is notable for its long half-life, which reduces withdrawal risk compared to other SSRIs but prolongs the time needed for washout before starting certain medications.",
