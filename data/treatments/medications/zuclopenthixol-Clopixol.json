  "description": "Zuclopenthixol is a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic of the thioxanthene class. It exerts its therapeutic effect primarily through antagonism of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the brain, reducing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. It is available in multiple formulations: oral tablets, zuclopenthixol acetate (short-acting injectable) for rapid control of acute agitation, and zuclopenthixol decanoate (long-acting depot injection) for maintenance therapy in chronic schizophrenia. Its use requires careful monitoring for extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and metabolic effects.",
