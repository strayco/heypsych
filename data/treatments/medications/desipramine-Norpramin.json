  "description": "Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that primarily inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine with minimal serotonergic activity. It is considered one of the more activating TCAs and is less sedating than others in its class. Desipramine is used in the treatment of major depressive disorder, especially in patients with fatigue or psychomotor retardation, and has off-label uses for neuropathic pain and ADHD. Due to its potential for cardiac conduction abnormalities and overdose toxicity, it is prescribed with caution.",
