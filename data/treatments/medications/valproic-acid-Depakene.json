  "summary": "Valproic acid is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and for migraine prophylaxis.",
  "description": "Valproic acid, marketed under brand names such as Depakene, is an antiepileptic drug with broad-spectrum activity against many seizure types. It is also effective as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder and in the prevention of migraines. Its mechanism involves enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity, modulating voltage-gated sodium channels, and inhibiting T-type calcium channels. It is available in oral and intravenous formulations.",
