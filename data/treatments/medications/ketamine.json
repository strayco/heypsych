  "summary": "A dissociative anesthetic used off-label in psychiatry for rapid-acting treatment of depression and suicidal ideation.",
  "description": "Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative with dissociative anesthetic and analgesic properties. In psychiatry, it is used off-label as a rapid-acting antidepressant, particularly for treatment-resistant depression and acute suicidal crises. It acts primarily as an NMDA receptor antagonist, leading to enhanced glutamate signaling and synaptogenesis. Administered via intravenous infusion, intranasal spray (off-label racemic ketamine), or other routes under medical supervision.",
