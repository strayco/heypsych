  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used in the treatment of schizophrenia.",
  "description": "Iloperidone is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic that works primarily through antagonism of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, along with effects on adrenergic receptors. It is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Due to its alpha-adrenergic blocking properties, it is associated with a risk of orthostatic hypotension, especially during initial titration.",
