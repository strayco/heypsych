  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used at low doses for dysthymia and depression in some countries.",
  "description": "Amisulpride is a substituted benzamide atypical antipsychotic that acts primarily as a selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist. At low doses (commonly 50–100 mg/day), it preferentially blocks presynaptic D2/D3 autoreceptors, enhancing dopaminergic transmission and exerting antidepressant effects. This indication is approved in some European countries but not in the United States.",
