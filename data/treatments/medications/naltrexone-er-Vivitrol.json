  "description": "Vivitrol is an extended-release intramuscular injection of naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist. It blocks the euphoric and sedative effects of opioids and reduces cravings in opioid-dependent patients. It also helps reduce heavy drinking in alcohol use disorder. Unlike oral naltrexone, Vivitrol provides continuous therapeutic levels for one month per injection, improving adherence.",
