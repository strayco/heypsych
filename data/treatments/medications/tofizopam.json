  "summary": "Tofizopam is an anxiolytic benzodiazepine derivative with minimal sedative and muscle relaxant effects, used in some countries for anxiety and related disorders.",
  "description": "Tofizopam is a 2,3-benzodiazepine derivative that differs structurally from the more common 1,4-benzodiazepines. It is used in certain countries (primarily in Europe and Asia) for the management of anxiety disorders, psychosomatic conditions, and related symptoms. Unlike classical benzodiazepines, tofizopam has limited sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant properties, making it more suitable for daytime use. It also exhibits mild cognitive-enhancing and psychostimulant effects in some patients. It is not approved for use in the United States.",
