  "summary": "A carbamate-derivative anxiolytic historically used for anxiety disorders, largely replaced by benzodiazepines due to dependence risks.",
  "description": "Meprobamate is a carbamate-derivative anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic that was widely prescribed in the 1950s and 1960s for the treatment of anxiety and tension. It acts as a central nervous system depressant, likely through modulation of GABA_A receptor function, although its exact mechanism is not fully understood. Due to significant risks of dependence, overdose, and withdrawal, it has largely been replaced by benzodiazepines and is now rarely used in most countries.",
