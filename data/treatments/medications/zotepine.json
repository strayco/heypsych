  "summary": "Zotepine is an atypical antipsychotic used primarily for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.",
  "description": "Zotepine is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic with dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonism, and additional noradrenaline reuptake inhibition. It is used in the management of schizophrenia, particularly in cases with negative symptoms, and in some mood disorders. Zotepine is not widely available in all countries, and its use is more common in parts of Europe and Asia. Sedative and weight gain effects are notable, and careful metabolic monitoring is recommended.",
