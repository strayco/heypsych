  "description": "Mesoridazine is a piperidine phenothiazine antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. It is a metabolite of thioridazine and works primarily by antagonizing dopamine D2 receptors, reducing positive symptoms of psychosis. It was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2004 due to risk of QT prolongation and serious ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes.",
