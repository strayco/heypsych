  "summary": "Secobarbital (Seconal) is a short-acting barbiturate used for short-term treatment of insomnia and for preoperative sedation.",
  "description": "Secobarbital, marketed as Seconal, is a short-acting barbiturate sedative-hypnotic. It enhances inhibitory neurotransmission via positive allosteric modulation of GABA-A receptors, leading to CNS depression. It is indicated for short-term management of insomnia and as a preanesthetic sedative. Due to risks of tolerance, dependence, misuse, and respiratory depression, use is limited and closely monitored.",
