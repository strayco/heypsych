  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used for schizophrenia and as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder.",
  "description": "Brexpiprazole is a serotonin-dopamine activity modulator and atypical antipsychotic. It is approved in the United States and several other countries for the treatment of schizophrenia and as an adjunct to antidepressants in major depressive disorder (MDD). Compared to aripiprazole, brexpiprazole has lower intrinsic activity at dopamine D2 receptors and higher affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, potentially resulting in lower rates of akathisia and improved tolerability.",
