  "summary": "Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist primarily used to treat high blood pressure and, off-label, to reduce nightmares and improve sleep in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
  "description": "Prazosin, sold under the brand name Minipress, is an antihypertensive medication in the alpha-1 adrenergic blocker class. It works by relaxing blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow and reducing blood pressure. Beyond hypertension, prazosin is often used off-label for PTSD-related nightmares and sleep disturbances. Its effectiveness in these cases is linked to its ability to reduce sympathetic nervous system activity during sleep. It is typically taken orally and requires titration to avoid side effects such as orthostatic hypotension.",
