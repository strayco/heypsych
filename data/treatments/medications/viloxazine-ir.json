  "summary": "Viloxazine immediate-release is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor previously used as an antidepressant in Europe.",
  "description": "Viloxazine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) with additional serotonergic activity. In its immediate-release formulation, it was marketed in several European countries from the 1970s until the early 2000s for the treatment of depression. While no longer widely available in IR form, viloxazine has since been reformulated as an extended-release capsule (Qelbree) for ADHD in the United States. Historical use suggests antidepressant efficacy with a generally favorable tolerability profile compared to tricyclic antidepressants.",
