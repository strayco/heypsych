  "summary": "Zaleplon is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic used for the short-term treatment of insomnia, particularly for difficulty falling asleep.",
  "description": "Zaleplon, marketed under the brand name Sonata, is a pyrazolopyrimidine-class nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic indicated for short-term management of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep initiation. It acts as a selective agonist at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor complex, enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition in the CNS. Zaleplon has an ultra-short half-life, making it useful for sleep onset problems but not for maintaining sleep.",
