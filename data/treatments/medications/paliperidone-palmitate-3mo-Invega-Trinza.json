It is designed for extended dosing intervals to improve adherence in patients requiring maintenance antipsychotic therapy. Paliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone and works as a dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. The 3-month injectable is administered every 12 weeks after adequate stabilization on the 1-month formulation (Invega Sustenna).",
