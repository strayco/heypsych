  "description": "Cinolazepam is a short-acting benzodiazepine with strong sedative and hypnotic properties. It is indicated mainly for the short-term treatment of insomnia, particularly when difficulty initiating sleep is the main complaint. Due to its pharmacokinetic profile, cinolazepam has a rapid onset of action and a relatively short elimination half-life, reducing next-day residual sedation compared to longer-acting benzodiazepines. It is not approved in the United States and is available in select European markets.",
