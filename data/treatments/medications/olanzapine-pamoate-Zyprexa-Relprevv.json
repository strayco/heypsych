  "summary": "A long-acting injectable formulation of olanzapine used for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.",
  "description": "Olanzapine pamoate, marketed as Zyprexa Relprevv, is a long-acting injectable (LAI) atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. It delivers sustained therapeutic plasma concentrations of olanzapine over 2–4 weeks, reducing the need for daily oral dosing. Like oral olanzapine, it acts as an antagonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, with additional antagonism at histamine H1, alpha-1 adrenergic, and muscarinic receptors. This formulation carries a unique boxed warning for post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS).",
