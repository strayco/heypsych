  "summary": "Rasagiline, marketed as Azilect, is a monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor used to treat Parkinson's disease, either as monotherapy in early disease or as an adjunct to levodopa in later stages.",
  "description": "Rasagiline is a selective, irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B, an enzyme that breaks down dopamine in the brain. By inhibiting dopamine breakdown, it increases and prolongs dopamine activity, improving motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. It is typically used to delay the need for levodopa in early stages or to smooth out motor fluctuations when used with levodopa in advanced disease.",
