  "summary": "A tetracyclic antidepressant used for depression, particularly in patients who require sedation.",
  "description": "Mianserin is a tetracyclic antidepressant with noradrenergic and specific serotonergic properties. It blocks presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, increasing norepinephrine and serotonin release, and antagonizes certain serotonin receptors (5-HT2, 5-HT3) as well as histamine H1 receptors, contributing to sedative effects. It is not approved in the United States but is available in several countries for major depressive disorder and sometimes for insomnia related to depression.",
