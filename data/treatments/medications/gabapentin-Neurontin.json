  "summary": "An anticonvulsant and neuropathic pain agent often used off-label for anxiety and mood disorders.",
  "description": "Gabapentin is a structural analogue of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that binds to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the CNS. It is approved for the treatment of partial seizures and postherpetic neuralgia, but is also widely prescribed off-label for anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, insomnia, and alcohol withdrawal. It is not a controlled substance in most jurisdictions, but has some misuse potential.",
