  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used for schizophrenia and, at lower doses, for dysthymia in some countries.",
  "description": "Amisulpride is a substituted benzamide atypical antipsychotic that selectively antagonizes dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. It is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic schizophrenia and is notable for its dose-dependent pharmacology: at high doses, it blocks postsynaptic receptors to reduce positive symptoms; at low doses, it blocks presynaptic autoreceptors to enhance dopamine release and improve negative symptoms or dysthymia. It is not approved in the United States but is used in several European and other markets.",
