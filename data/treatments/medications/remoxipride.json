  "summary": "Remoxipride is an atypical antipsychotic formerly used in the treatment of schizophrenia but withdrawn due to the risk of aplastic anemia.",
  "description": "Remoxipride is an antipsychotic drug that was classified as an atypical benzamide derivative. It was used primarily for the management of schizophrenia, with a mechanism involving selective antagonism of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. Although it exhibited a lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms compared to typical antipsychotics, it was withdrawn from the market in several countries after cases of aplastic anemia were reported.",
