  "summary": "Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant and neuropathic pain agent used to treat epilepsy, fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and nerve pain associated with conditions like diabetes or shingles.",
  "description": "Pregabalin, marketed under the brand name Lyrica, is a structural analog of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but does not act directly on GABA receptors. Instead, it binds to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, reducing calcium influx at nerve terminals and thereby decreasing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. It is prescribed for partial-onset seizures, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and GAD in some regions. Pregabalin is taken orally and is known for its predictable absorption and rapid onset of action.",
