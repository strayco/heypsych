  "description": "Estazolam is a benzodiazepine with hypnotic, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant properties. It is primarily prescribed for the short-term management of insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings. Like other benzodiazepines, estazolam acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission.",
