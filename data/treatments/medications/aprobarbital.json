  "summary": "A short-acting barbiturate historically used as a sedative and hypnotic for insomnia and pre-procedural sedation.",
  "description": "Aprobarbital is a barbiturate derivative with sedative-hypnotic properties. It acts by enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission at the GABA-A receptor, leading to CNS depression. It was used for short-term treatment of insomnia and for preoperative sedation, but has largely been replaced by benzodiazepines and newer sleep aids due to the high risk of dependence, overdose, and safer alternatives.",
