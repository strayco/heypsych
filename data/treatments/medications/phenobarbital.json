  "summary": "Phenobarbital is a long-acting barbiturate used as an anticonvulsant and sedative-hypnotic for the treatment of seizure disorders, sedation, and, in some cases, withdrawal management.",
  "description": "Phenobarbital is a barbiturate that enhances GABA-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission by prolonging the duration of chloride channel opening at the GABA-A receptor, producing sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects. It is one of the oldest antiepileptic drugs and is primarily used for partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus, and seizure prophylaxis. It is also used off-label for alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal in certain cases.",
