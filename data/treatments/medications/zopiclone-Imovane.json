  "description": "Zopiclone, marketed under the brand name Imovane (and others), is a cyclopyrrolone-class sedative-hypnotic indicated for short-term management of insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, or early morning awakenings. It acts as a GABA-A receptor agonist at the benzodiazepine binding site, enhancing the inhibitory neurotransmitter effect of GABA in the central nervous system. Zopiclone is typically prescribed for brief periods (2–4 weeks) due to the risk of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal.",
