  "summary": "A long-acting synthetic opioid used for opioid use disorder maintenance therapy and chronic pain management.",
  "description": "Methadone is a long-acting synthetic opioid agonist used for maintenance therapy in opioid use disorder (OUD) and for the management of chronic severe pain. In addiction treatment, it prevents withdrawal symptoms and reduces cravings without producing the intense euphoria associated with short-acting opioids. Its long half-life allows for once-daily dosing in OUD. Due to the risk of respiratory depression, QT prolongation, and misuse, methadone must be prescribed and monitored under strict regulations in opioid treatment programs.",
