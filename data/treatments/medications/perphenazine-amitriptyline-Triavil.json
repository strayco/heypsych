  "summary": "Triavil is a combination medication containing perphenazine, a typical antipsychotic, and amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, used to treat certain psychiatric conditions with both depressive and psychotic features.",
  "description": "Triavil combines perphenazine, a phenothiazine antipsychotic, with amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, to address coexisting depression and psychosis or anxiety. It is typically prescribed for patients with conditions such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who also exhibit significant depressive symptoms. The combination provides mood elevation and antipsychotic effects in a single tablet but carries the side effect risks of both drug classes.",
