  "description": "Sodium valproate is the sodium salt of valproic acid, used widely as an antiepileptic and mood stabilizer. It is indicated for a range of seizure types, including generalized, focal, and absence seizures, as well as for acute mania in bipolar disorder and migraine prophylaxis. Its mechanism involves increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the brain, modulating voltage-gated sodium channels, and inhibiting T-type calcium channels. Sodium valproate can be administered orally or intravenously.",
