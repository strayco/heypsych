  "summary": "An herbal supplement traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine, studied for its potential cognitive-enhancing, anxiolytic, and adaptogenic effects.",
  "description": "Bacopa monnieri, also known as Brahmi, is a creeping herb native to wetlands in India and other parts of the world. It has been used in Ayurveda for centuries to improve memory, reduce anxiety, and promote overall well-being. Its active compounds, called bacosides, are thought to enhance synaptic communication and act as antioxidants. Modern research suggests modest cognitive and mood benefits, particularly with chronic use over several weeks.",
