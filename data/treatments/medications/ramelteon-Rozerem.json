  "summary": "Ramelteon, marketed as Rozerem, is a melatonin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep onset. It is non-habit-forming and has no evidence of abuse potential.",
  "description": "Ramelteon is a selective melatonin receptor agonist with high affinity for MT1 and MT2 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, which are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles. Unlike benzodiazepines or Z-drugs, it does not produce sedative or anxiolytic effects via GABA modulation, and it is not associated with withdrawal symptoms or dependence.",
