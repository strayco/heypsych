  "summary": "An anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer used in bipolar disorder and epilepsy.",
  "description": "Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant that inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes and modulating presynaptic transmitter release of excitatory amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate. In psychiatry, it is widely used for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, particularly effective for preventing depressive episodes, and has minimal risk of inducing mania. It is also FDA-approved for certain seizure types.",
