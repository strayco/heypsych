  "description": "Invega Hafyera is the longest-acting paliperidone formulation, designed for administration every 6 months. It is used for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults who are clinically stable on the 3-month paliperidone palmitate formulation (Invega Trinza). Paliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone and exerts its effect through dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism. The extended dosing interval supports long-term adherence in patients requiring chronic antipsychotic therapy.",
