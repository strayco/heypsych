  "description": "Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that reduces sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system, lowering blood pressure and producing calming effects. While originally developed for hypertension, it is also used in psychiatry for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, and the management of withdrawal symptoms from opioids, alcohol, and nicotine.",
