  "description": "Hydergine is a proprietary preparation containing dihydroergotoxine mesylate, a mixture of hydrogenated ergot alkaloids. It was historically prescribed to enhance cerebral blood flow, oxygen utilization, and neurotransmitter function, with the aim of improving cognitive performance in elderly patients and those with dementia. Its use has declined significantly due to limited evidence of efficacy and the availability of better-supported treatments.",
