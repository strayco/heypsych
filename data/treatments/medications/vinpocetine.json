  "summary": "Vinpocetine is a synthetic compound derived from the periwinkle plant, studied for its potential neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects.",
  "description": "Vinpocetine is a semisynthetic derivative of the alkaloid vincamine, found in the periwinkle plant (Vinca minor). It has been used in some countries as a prescription medication for cognitive impairment, stroke recovery, and cerebrovascular disorders. Vinpocetine is thought to enhance cerebral blood flow, improve oxygen and glucose utilization in the brain, and exert neuroprotective effects via multiple mechanisms. In the United States, vinpocetine has been marketed as a dietary supplement, though regulatory status is under review and the FDA has issued warnings regarding its inclusion in supplements.",
