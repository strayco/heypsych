  "description": "Chloral hydrate is a sedative-hypnotic drug that was widely used in the 19th and 20th centuries for insomnia, anxiety, and pre-surgical sedation. It is a prodrug metabolized to trichloroethanol, which acts as a central nervous system depressant. Although effective, it has largely been replaced by safer and more predictable agents due to its narrow therapeutic index, risk of dependence, and potential for severe toxicity in overdose.",
