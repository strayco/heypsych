  "summary": "Paliperidone is an atypical antipsychotic used for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.",
  "description": "Paliperidone is the primary active metabolite of risperidone. It works by antagonizing dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, reducing positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia while minimizing extrapyramidal side effects. Available in extended-release oral and long-acting injectable forms, paliperidone is known for once-daily dosing and consistent plasma levels.",
