  "description": "Tiagabine, marketed under the brand name Gabitril, is an antiepileptic drug primarily indicated as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in patients with epilepsy. It works by inhibiting the reuptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into presynaptic neurons and glial cells, thereby increasing the availability of GABA in the synaptic cleft and enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission. Tiagabine is not typically used as monotherapy and is associated with a risk of provoking seizures in individuals without epilepsy or when used off-label for non-epileptic conditions.",
