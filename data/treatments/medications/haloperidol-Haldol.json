  "description": "Haloperidol is a high-potency typical antipsychotic of the butyrophenone class. It is a potent dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with strong antipsychotic effects and relatively low sedative properties. It is used in oral form for chronic treatment and acute symptom control, intramuscular/intravenous form for rapid tranquilization, and as a long-acting decanoate ester for maintenance therapy in schizophrenia and related disorders.",
