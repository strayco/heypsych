  "description": "Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant that inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, with strong antihistaminic and sedative properties. It is indicated for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and insomnia at lower doses. At higher doses, it functions primarily as an antidepressant; at lower doses, it is used as a hypnotic due to potent histamine H1 receptor antagonism.",
