  "description": "Isocarboxazid is a non-selective, irreversible MAOI that increases synaptic levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. It is generally used in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and certain anxiety disorders. Due to dietary restrictions and interaction risks, it is usually prescribed when other treatments have failed.",
