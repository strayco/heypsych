  "description": "Low-dose doxepin is a selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist at these doses, with minimal antidepressant or anticholinergic effects. Marketed under the brand name Silenor, it is indicated for sleep maintenance insomnia in adults. Unlike higher doses of doxepin used for depression and anxiety, low-dose doxepin primarily works as a sedative without significant effects on norepinephrine or serotonin reuptake.",
