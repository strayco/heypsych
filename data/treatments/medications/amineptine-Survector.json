  "description": "Amineptine is an atypical tricyclic antidepressant that primarily inhibits dopamine reuptake with mild norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. It was used for the treatment of major depressive disorder, particularly with psychomotor retardation. Due to concerns about hepatotoxicity and potential for abuse, it has been withdrawn from the market in most countries.",
