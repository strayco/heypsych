  "summary": "A combination of a tricyclic antidepressant and a benzodiazepine, used for depression with significant anxiety.",
  "description": "Limbitrol combines amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, with chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine that enhances GABAergic neurotransmission. This combination is intended for patients with depressive disorders accompanied by marked anxiety. It is less commonly prescribed today due to safety concerns related to benzodiazepines and the side effect profile of TCAs.",
