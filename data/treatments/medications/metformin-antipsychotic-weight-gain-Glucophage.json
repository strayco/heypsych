  "summary": "A biguanide antihyperglycemic agent used off-label to mitigate weight gain and metabolic disturbances from antipsychotic medications.",
  "description": "Metformin is an oral biguanide used primarily for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Off-label, it is prescribed to reduce weight gain, insulin resistance, and other metabolic effects associated with antipsychotic treatment—particularly second-generation antipsychotics like olanzapine and clozapine. Its mechanism involves decreasing hepatic glucose production, improving peripheral insulin sensitivity, and modestly reducing appetite. Clinical studies support its role in attenuating weight gain and improving metabolic parameters in psychiatric populations.",
