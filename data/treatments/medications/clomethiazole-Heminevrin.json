  "description": "Clomethiazole is a thiazole derivative with potent sedative and hypnotic effects. It acts as a GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulator, similar to barbiturates and benzodiazepines, but with a distinct chemical structure. It is primarily used in Europe for short-term treatment of severe insomnia in the elderly and for controlling agitation in acute alcohol withdrawal. Due to its dependence potential and risk of respiratory depression, it is usually restricted to inpatient or closely supervised use.",
