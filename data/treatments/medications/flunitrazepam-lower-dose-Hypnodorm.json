  "description": "Flunitrazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with strong hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects. In some countries, such as Australia, lower-dose formulations (Hypnodorm) are prescribed for severe insomnia when other treatments have failed. Due to its potency, long half-life, and high risk for misuse, it is subject to strict regulation and is not approved in the United States.",
