  "description": "Cyclobarbital is a barbiturate derivative with sedative-hypnotic properties, historically prescribed for short-term treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Like other barbiturates, it potentiates GABA-A receptor activity, producing CNS depression. It has largely fallen out of clinical use because of the high risk of dependence, overdose, and respiratory depression, and has been replaced by benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.",
