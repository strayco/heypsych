  "description": "Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) approved mainly for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) but also used for major depressive disorder and various anxiety disorders. It has a high affinity for the serotonin transporter, increasing synaptic serotonin, and also acts on sigma-1 receptors, which may contribute to its anxiolytic properties.",
