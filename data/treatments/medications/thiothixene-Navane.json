  "summary": "Thiothixene (Navane) is a first-generation antipsychotic used to manage schizophrenia symptoms.",
  "description": "Thiothixene, marketed under the brand name Navane, is a high-potency first-generation (typical) antipsychotic in the thioxanthene class. It primarily exerts its effects by antagonizing dopamine D2 receptors in the brain, which helps reduce psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorders. Due to its potency, it is effective at relatively low doses but carries a higher risk of extrapyramidal side effects. It is used mainly for the treatment of schizophrenia and is not considered a first-line therapy today due to the availability of second-generation antipsychotics with more favorable side effect profiles.",
