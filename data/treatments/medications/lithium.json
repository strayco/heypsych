  "summary": "A classic mood stabilizer used for bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and augmentation in depression.",
  "description": "Lithium is an elemental mood stabilizer with anti-manic, anti-depressive, and anti-suicidal properties. It is primarily used in the management of bipolar disorder for both acute mania and maintenance therapy. Lithium also has evidence for reducing suicide risk and may be used as an augmentation strategy in major depressive disorder. Due to its narrow therapeutic index, serum levels must be closely monitored.",
