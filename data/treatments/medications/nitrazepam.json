  "summary": "A benzodiazepine hypnotic used primarily for the short-term treatment of insomnia and certain seizure disorders.",
  "description": "Nitrazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant properties. It is primarily prescribed for the short-term management of insomnia, especially when difficulty in maintaining sleep is present. It has also been used in epilepsy treatment, particularly for certain pediatric seizure types, but is less common today due to safety concerns and tolerance development.",
