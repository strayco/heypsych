  "summary": "An oral neuroactive steroid antidepressant approved for the treatment of postpartum depression, with ongoing investigation for major depressive disorder.",
  "description": "Zuranolone is a neuroactive steroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, similar to brexanolone but available in an oral formulation. In August 2023, zuranolone became the first oral medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of postpartum depression. It is being studied for major depressive disorder (MDD) as well. Administered once daily for 14 days, zuranolone can lead to rapid improvement in depressive symptoms. Due to risks of excessive sedation and potential for impairment, it is available only through a restricted program under a REMS.",
