  "summary": "A discontinued antidepressant with dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition properties, formerly used for major depressive disorder.",
  "description": "Nomifensine was an atypical antidepressant with a unique mechanism involving dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. It was prescribed mainly for major depressive disorder and sometimes for atypical depression due to its activating effects. Marketed as Merital, it was withdrawn in the 1980s because of safety concerns, including hemolytic anemia and rare cases of severe hepatitis and immune-related reactions. It is no longer available clinically but remains of interest in pharmacological research.",
