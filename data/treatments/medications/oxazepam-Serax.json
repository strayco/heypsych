  "summary": "Oxazepam is a short- to intermediate-acting benzodiazepine used for the treatment of anxiety disorders, alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and for short-term relief of insomnia.",
  "description": "Oxazepam is a benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. It works by enhancing the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor, producing calming effects on the central nervous system. It has a relatively slow onset and is often preferred in elderly patients and those with liver impairment due to its direct glucuronidation metabolism.",
