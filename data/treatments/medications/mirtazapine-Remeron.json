  "summary": "A noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) used for major depressive disorder, often beneficial for patients with insomnia or poor appetite.",
  "description": "Mirtazapine is an atypical antidepressant that works by antagonizing central presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors, increasing norepinephrine and serotonin release, and blocking certain serotonin receptors (5-HT2, 5-HT3) while strongly antagonizing histamine H1 receptors. This combination can improve mood and anxiety while promoting sleep and increasing appetite. It is particularly useful in patients with depression accompanied by insomnia, weight loss, or poor appetite.",
