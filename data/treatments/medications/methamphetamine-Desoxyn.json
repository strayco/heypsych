  "summary": "A central nervous system stimulant used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and short-term treatment of obesity.",
  "description": "Methamphetamine hydrochloride, marketed under the brand name Desoxyn, is a potent CNS stimulant. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD and short-term management of exogenous obesity when other treatments have failed. Due to its high potential for abuse, dependence, and diversion, its use is strictly regulated. The medication increases synaptic concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, leading to improved attention, focus, and alertness in ADHD, but it carries significant cardiovascular and psychiatric risks.",
