  "description": "Risperidone microspheres LAI is an extended-release formulation using biodegradable polymer microspheres to deliver risperidone over a two-week period. It is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and as maintenance therapy in bipolar I disorder. This formulation improves adherence by reducing dosing frequency and maintaining stable plasma drug concentrations. It works through antagonism of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, helping to alleviate both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis and stabilize mood.",
