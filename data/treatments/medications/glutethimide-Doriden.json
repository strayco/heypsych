  "description": "Glutethimide is a nonbarbiturate sedative-hypnotic that was once prescribed for the short-term treatment of insomnia. It acts as a central nervous system depressant, producing sedation and sleep induction. It was withdrawn from the market in most countries due to its high risk of dependence, respiratory depression, and lethal overdose potential, especially when combined with alcohol or other depressants.",
