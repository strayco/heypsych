  "description": "Temazepam, marketed under the brand name Restoril, is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia, particularly when difficulty in falling asleep or frequent nighttime awakenings cause distress or impaired functioning. It enhances the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA at the GABA-A receptor, producing sedative, anxiolytic, and muscle-relaxant effects. Temazepam is typically prescribed for 7–10 days due to the risk of dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal. It is a Schedule IV controlled substance in the U.S.",
