  "summary": "Zolpidem CR is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic for the short-term treatment of insomnia, formulated for both sleep initiation and maintenance.",
  "description": "Zolpidem tartrate extended-release, marketed as Ambien CR, is a sedative-hypnotic indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation and/or maintenance. It has a biphasic release mechanism—an initial layer to promote sleep onset, followed by a slower release to maintain sleep. Like immediate-release zolpidem, it selectively binds to the benzodiazepine site of the alpha1-containing GABA-A receptor, enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission. Lower doses are recommended for women and older adults to minimize next-day impairment.",
