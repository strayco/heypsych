  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used primarily in Japan for the treatment of schizophrenia.",
  "description": "Mosapramine is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic with antagonistic activity at dopamine D2, D3, and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. It is primarily prescribed in Japan for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. It has a pharmacological profile similar to other atypicals but retains relatively strong dopamine antagonism, which can lead to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) at higher doses.",
