  "summary": "Thioridazine (Mellaril) is a first-generation antipsychotic primarily used for schizophrenia but largely discontinued due to cardiac and retinal toxicity risks.",
  "description": "Thioridazine, formerly marketed under the brand name Mellaril, is a low-potency first-generation (typical) antipsychotic of the phenothiazine class. It works mainly by antagonizing dopamine D2 receptors in the brain, reducing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Due to a high risk of QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes, and irreversible pigmentary retinopathy, thioridazine has been withdrawn or severely restricted in many countries. When available, it is typically reserved for patients with schizophrenia who have not responded to other antipsychotic treatments.",
