  "description": "Citalopram is an SSRI antidepressant indicated for major depressive disorder (MDD) and sometimes used off-label for anxiety disorders such as panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. It is a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers, with the S-enantiomer (escitalopram) being primarily responsible for its antidepressant effect. While effective and generally well tolerated, citalopram carries a dose-dependent risk of QT prolongation, which limits its maximum recommended dose.",
