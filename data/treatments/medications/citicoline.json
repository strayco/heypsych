  "summary": "A neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing supplement used for stroke recovery, memory disorders, and other neurological conditions.",
  "description": "Citicoline (cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine, CDP-choline) is a naturally occurring compound involved in phospholipid synthesis. It is used as a dietary supplement and in some countries as a prescription medication for cognitive impairment, stroke recovery, and traumatic brain injury. Citicoline may enhance neuronal membrane repair, improve acetylcholine synthesis, and support mitochondrial function. While evidence supports its use in certain neurological conditions, results are mixed in dementia and general cognitive enhancement.",
