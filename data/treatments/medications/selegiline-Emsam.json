  "description": "Selegiline, marketed in transdermal form as Emsam, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. At the lowest available dose (6 mg/24 hr), it is relatively selective for MAO-B and does not require dietary tyramine restrictions. At higher doses (9 mg/24 hr and 12 mg/24 hr), it inhibits both MAO-A and MAO-B, necessitating dietary precautions to avoid hypertensive crisis. The transdermal delivery bypasses significant gastrointestinal metabolism, allowing more consistent drug levels and reduced gastrointestinal side effects compared to oral MAOIs.",
