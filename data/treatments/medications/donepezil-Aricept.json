  "description": "Donepezil is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved for the symptomatic treatment of mild, moderate, and severe Alzheimer’s disease. It works by increasing acetylcholine levels in the brain, which may help improve or stabilize cognitive function in patients with dementia. While not a cure, it may slow the progression of cognitive decline in some patients.",
