  "summary": "A tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) used to treat depression, certain types of chronic pain, and off-label for migraine prevention.",
  "description": "Nortriptyline is a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant, the active metabolite of amitriptyline. It works primarily by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and, to a lesser extent, serotonin, thereby increasing their concentrations in the synaptic cleft. It has fewer sedative and anticholinergic effects than tertiary amine TCAs, making it better tolerated in some patients. In addition to depression, it is often used off-label for neuropathic pain, migraine prophylaxis, and insomnia associated with chronic pain.",
