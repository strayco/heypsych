  "description": "Risperidone LAI, marketed as Risperdal Consta, is an extended-release injectable formulation of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. It is administered intramuscularly every two weeks to provide sustained symptom control in schizophrenia and as maintenance therapy in bipolar I disorder. The long-acting formulation improves adherence and stabilizes plasma concentrations compared to oral risperidone. It works by antagonizing dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, helping reduce both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis.",
