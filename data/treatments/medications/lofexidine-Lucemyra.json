  "summary": "An alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used to manage symptoms of opioid withdrawal.",
  "description": "Lofexidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist approved for mitigation of withdrawal symptoms in patients discontinuing opioids. It works by reducing the release of norepinephrine, thereby alleviating autonomic symptoms such as sweating, chills, anxiety, and tachycardia. Unlike methadone or buprenorphine, lofexidine is not an opioid and does not reduce cravings, but it can be used as a non-opioid option for detoxification.",
