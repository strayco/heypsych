  "description": "Rufinamide, marketed under the brand name Banzel, is an antiepileptic drug primarily indicated for the treatment of seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a rare and severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy. Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is thought to modulate the activity of voltage-gated sodium channels, stabilizing the neuronal membrane and reducing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.",
