  "summary": "Valnoctamide is a mood-stabilizing and anticonvulsant drug investigated for bipolar disorder, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain.",
  "description": "Valnoctamide is a derivative of valproic acid with anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing properties. Unlike valproic acid, it is not a carboxylic acid but an amide, which alters its pharmacokinetics and side-effect profile. Valnoctamide has been studied for acute mania in bipolar disorder, seizure disorders, and neuropathic pain. It may have fewer teratogenic risks compared to valproic acid, making it of interest for use in women of childbearing potential. Its exact mechanism of action is unclear but may involve modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels, enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission, and inhibition of histone deacetylases.",
