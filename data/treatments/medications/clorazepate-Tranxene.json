  "summary": "A long-acting benzodiazepine used for anxiety disorders, acute alcohol withdrawal, and as an adjunct in seizure disorders.",
  "description": "Clorazepate is a benzodiazepine prodrug that is rapidly converted in the stomach to the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam (nordiazepam). It exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects through potentiation of GABA-A receptor activity. Its long half-life makes it suitable for continuous symptom control but may lead to accumulation with prolonged use.",
