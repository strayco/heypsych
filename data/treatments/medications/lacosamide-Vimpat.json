  "summary": "An anticonvulsant primarily used for partial-onset seizures, sometimes used off-label in psychiatry for mood stabilization.",
  "description": "Lacosamide is an anticonvulsant that selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, stabilizing hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibiting repetitive neuronal firing. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of partial-onset seizures and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In psychiatry, it has limited but emerging off-label use for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder and adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant cases.",
