  "summary": "Prochlorperazine is an antipsychotic and antiemetic medication used primarily to control severe nausea and vomiting, and to treat schizophrenia and anxiety. It belongs to the phenothiazine class of drugs.",
  "description": "Prochlorperazine, sold under the brand name Compazine, is a typical antipsychotic of the phenothiazine class with potent dopamine D2 receptor antagonist properties. It is widely used for the control of severe nausea and vomiting of various causes, including postoperative states, chemotherapy, and migraines. In psychiatric practice, it is sometimes prescribed for schizophrenia and acute psychosis, and occasionally for short-term treatment of generalized anxiety. Its antiemetic effects are due to dopamine blockade in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, while its antipsychotic effects result from dopamine blockade in mesolimbic pathways.",
