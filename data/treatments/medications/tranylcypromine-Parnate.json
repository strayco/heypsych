  "description": "Tranylcypromine, marketed under the brand name Parnate, is a non-selective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults who have not responded adequately to other antidepressants. It works by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, leading to increased levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain. Due to the risk of severe dietary and drug interactions, tranylcypromine is typically reserved for treatment-resistant depression and requires strict adherence to dietary restrictions to avoid hypertensive crises.",
