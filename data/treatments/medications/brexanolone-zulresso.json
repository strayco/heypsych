  "description": "Brexanolone is a synthetic formulation of allopregnanolone, an endogenous neuroactive steroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor. It is the first medication specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD). Administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over 60 hours under medical supervision, brexanolone can lead to rapid improvement in depressive symptoms. Its use is restricted to certified healthcare settings due to the risks of excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness.",
