  "summary": "A central nervous system stimulant used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",
  "description": "Dexmethylphenidate is the d-threo-enantiomer of methylphenidate and is thought to be the more pharmacologically active form. It blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into presynaptic neurons, increasing their levels in the synaptic cleft. Dexmethylphenidate is indicated for the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults, and may have a lower required dose compared to racemic methylphenidate.",
