  "summary": "A benzodiazepine derivative primarily used for anxiety disorders, with relatively mild sedative effects compared to other benzodiazepines.",
  "description": "Camazepam is an oral benzodiazepine used in certain countries for the treatment of anxiety disorders. It acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, enhancing the inhibitory effects of GABA in the central nervous system. Compared to many other benzodiazepines, camazepam has a relatively mild sedative and muscle relaxant effect, which can make it suitable for patients requiring anxiolysis without pronounced sedation. It is not approved for use in the United States.",
