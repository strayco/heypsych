  "description": "Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant properties. It is commonly used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, acute agitation, insomnia, and status epilepticus. Lorazepam is notable for its intermediate half-life and lack of active metabolites, making it useful in patients with hepatic impairment.",
