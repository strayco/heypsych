  "summary": "A short- to intermediate-acting barbiturate used primarily in combination with other agents for tension or migraine headaches.",
  "description": "Butalbital is a barbiturate with sedative and muscle-relaxant properties. It is most often prescribed in fixed-dose combination products with acetaminophen, aspirin, and/or caffeine for the relief of tension headaches and sometimes migraine headaches. Its CNS depressant effects help alleviate muscle contraction-associated pain, but the drug carries risks of dependence, sedation, and rebound headaches with long-term use.",
