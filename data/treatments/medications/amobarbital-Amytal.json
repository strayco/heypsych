  "summary": "A short- to intermediate-acting barbiturate formerly used for insomnia, anxiety, and as a pre-anesthetic agent.",
  "description": "Amobarbital is a barbiturate that depresses the central nervous system by enhancing GABAergic inhibition at the GABA-A receptor. Historically marketed as Amytal, it was used for insomnia, acute anxiety, sedation, and as part of 'narcoanalysis' in psychiatry. Due to risks of dependence, overdose, and the availability of safer alternatives, it is now rarely used in most countries.",
