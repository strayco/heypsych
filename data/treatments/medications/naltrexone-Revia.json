  "summary": "An oral opioid antagonist used to treat alcohol dependence and prevent relapse in opioid dependence.",
  "description": "Revia is the oral formulation of naltrexone, a competitive opioid receptor antagonist. It blocks the euphoric and sedative effects of opioids and reduces cravings in opioid-dependent patients. It also helps reduce heavy drinking in alcohol use disorder. Daily oral dosing requires adherence, which may limit its effectiveness compared to the extended-release injectable form.",
