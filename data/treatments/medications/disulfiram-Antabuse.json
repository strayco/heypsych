  "description": "Disulfiram is an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor used as a deterrent in the treatment of chronic alcohol dependence. When alcohol is consumed, it leads to the accumulation of acetaldehyde, producing uncomfortable effects such as flushing, nausea, vomiting, headache, and palpitations. Disulfiram is intended to support abstinence by discouraging alcohol intake through conditioned aversion.",
