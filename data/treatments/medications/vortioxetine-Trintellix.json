  "description": "Vortioxetine, marketed under the brand name Trintellix (formerly Brintellix in some regions), is a multimodal antidepressant indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. It works through a combination of serotonin transporter inhibition and modulation of multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes. This dual action is thought to contribute to improvements in mood, cognition, and overall depressive symptoms.",
