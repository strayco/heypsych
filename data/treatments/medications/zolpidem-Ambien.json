  "description": "Zolpidem, marketed under the brand name Ambien (and others), is a sedative-hypnotic medication indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation or maintenance. It belongs to the imidazopyridine class and acts as a selective agonist at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor, enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission and promoting sleep. It has a rapid onset of action and a relatively short half-life, reducing next-day sedation risk. Lower doses are often used to reduce the risk of next-morning impairment, particularly in women and older adults.",
