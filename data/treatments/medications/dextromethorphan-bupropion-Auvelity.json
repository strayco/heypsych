  "summary": "A combination medication approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder, combining NMDA receptor antagonism and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibition.",
  "description": "Auvelity is an oral combination of dextromethorphan hydrobromide and bupropion hydrochloride. Dextromethorphan acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, sigma-1 receptor agonist, and serotonin reuptake inhibitor, while bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and CYP2D6 inhibitor, prolonging dextromethorphan's half-life. This combination provides a novel mechanism for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) and offers a rapid onset of antidepressant effects.",
