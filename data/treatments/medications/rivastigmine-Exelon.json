  "summary": "Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used for mild to moderate dementia in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.",
  "description": "Rivastigmine, marketed as Exelon, is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor that works by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, enzymes that break down acetylcholine. This increases acetylcholine levels in the brain, enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission, which may help improve cognition and function in individuals with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. Available as oral capsules, oral solution, and transdermal patches, rivastigmine is often chosen when gastrointestinal side effects limit the use of other cholinesterase inhibitors.",
