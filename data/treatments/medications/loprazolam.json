  "description": "Loprazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic with anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant properties. It is primarily indicated for the short-term management of severe insomnia and sleep disturbances. Its relatively short half-life makes it suitable for patients who have difficulty falling asleep without significant next-day sedation when used appropriately.",
