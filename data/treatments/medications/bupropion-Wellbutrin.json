  "description": "Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is an antidepressant of the norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor class. It is indicated for major depressive disorder and seasonal affective disorder, and is also used as an aid in smoking cessation under other brand names (e.g., Zyban). Bupropion has a unique mechanism distinct from SSRIs and SNRIs, with minimal sexual side effects and no significant weight gain. Available in immediate-release (IR), sustained-release (SR), and extended-release (XL) formulations.",
