  "description": "Safinamide, marketed under the brand name Xadago, is an oral medication approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa in patients experiencing 'off' episodes. It acts as a selective and reversible monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, increasing dopamine levels in the brain, and also exhibits non-dopaminergic effects including inhibition of glutamate release. This dual mechanism helps improve motor control and reduce fluctuations in symptoms.",
