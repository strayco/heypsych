  "description": "Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) that promotes sleep by inhibiting the wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and B from binding to their receptors (OX1R and OX2R). It is FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia in adults, particularly for those with difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep.",
