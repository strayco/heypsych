  "summary": "A long-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic used for short-term management of insomnia.",
  "description": "Flurazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that enhances the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA at the GABA-A receptor, resulting in sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects. It is used primarily for insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early-morning awakenings. Due to its long half-life and accumulation of active metabolites, it may cause next-day sedation, particularly in older adults.",
