  "summary": "Tianeptine (Stablon) is an atypical antidepressant used primarily for the treatment of major depressive disorder.",
  "description": "Tianeptine, marketed under the brand name Stablon, is an atypical antidepressant with unique pharmacological properties. Unlike conventional SSRIs, tianeptine enhances serotonin uptake in the brain and modulates glutamatergic activity. It also exhibits neuroplasticity-promoting effects and may reduce stress-induced changes in the brain. Tianeptine is approved in several countries for major depressive disorder but is not FDA-approved in the United States. It is generally well-tolerated but has a potential for misuse at high doses.",
