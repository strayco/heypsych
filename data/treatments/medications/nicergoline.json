  "summary": "An ergot derivative used to improve cognitive function and cerebral blood flow, primarily in vascular dementia and age-related cognitive decline.",
  "description": "Nicergoline is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid that acts as an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, increasing cerebral blood flow and enhancing neuronal metabolism. It has been used for cognitive impairment due to vascular causes, age-related memory loss, and other neurological conditions. It is not approved in the United States but is prescribed in several European and Asian countries.",
