  "description": "Ziprasidone, marketed under the brand name Geodon, is an atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and as maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder. Its mechanism involves antagonism of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, as well as partial agonism/antagonism at other serotonin receptors and inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. Ziprasidone is known for a lower risk of metabolic side effects compared to some other atypical antipsychotics, but it can prolong the QT interval and should be used with caution in patients with cardiac risk factors.",
