  "summary": "Valproate magnesium is a magnesium salt form of valproic acid used as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer.",
  "description": "Valproate magnesium is the magnesium salt of valproic acid, an established antiepileptic and mood-stabilizing medication. It is used in the management of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and for migraine prophylaxis. Valproate magnesium shares the pharmacological actions of other valproate formulations, primarily increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in the brain, which leads to reduced neuronal excitability. The magnesium component may improve gastrointestinal tolerance in some patients compared to other valproate salts.",
