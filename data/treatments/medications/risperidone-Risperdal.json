  "description": "Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication that works primarily through antagonism of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. It is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder. Risperidone can be administered orally as tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, or oral solution. It is effective in reducing positive and negative symptoms of psychosis and stabilizing mood.",
