  "summary": "The combination of quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic, and nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, may be used off-label for treatment-resistant depression or comorbid psychiatric conditions requiring both mood stabilization and antidepressant effects.",
  "description": "Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic that antagonizes dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, among others, producing antipsychotic, mood-stabilizing, and sedative effects. Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, enhancing neurotransmission in the central nervous system. When used together, these agents may address both depressive and psychotic symptoms, though the combination is not FDA-approved and carries increased risk for adverse effects, including sedation, anticholinergic effects, and cardiovascular complications.",
