  "summary": "A combination medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder, pairing a partial opioid agonist with an opioid antagonist to reduce misuse potential.",
  "description": "Suboxone combines buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist that suppresses withdrawal and cravings, with naloxone, an opioid antagonist included to deter misuse via injection. When taken sublingually or buccally as prescribed, naloxone has minimal bioavailability, but if injected, it can precipitate withdrawal. It is approved for maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder in many countries and is a cornerstone of medication-assisted treatment (MAT).",
