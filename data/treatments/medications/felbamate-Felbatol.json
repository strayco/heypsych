  "summary": "An anticonvulsant used in severe epilepsy cases, particularly Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and refractory partial seizures.",
  "description": "Felbamate is an anticonvulsant that inhibits NMDA receptor activity and modulates GABA-A receptor responses. Due to its association with rare but serious adverse effects, such as aplastic anemia and hepatic failure, felbamate is reserved for severe, treatment-resistant epilepsy, including Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and refractory partial seizures.",
