  "description": "Clonidine ER (Kapvay) is an extended-release formulation of clonidine, a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. It reduces sympathetic nervous system activity, producing calming effects and improving attention in ADHD. The extended-release form allows for smoother plasma levels and reduced sedation compared to immediate-release clonidine. It is often used alone or in combination with stimulants, particularly when hyperactivity, impulsivity, or sleep disturbances are prominent.",
