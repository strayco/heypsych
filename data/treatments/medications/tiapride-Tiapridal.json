  "summary": "Tiapride (Tiapridal) is an antipsychotic used primarily to treat agitation in elderly patients, alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and movement disorders.",
  "description": "Tiapride, marketed under the brand name Tiapridal, is an atypical antipsychotic from the substituted benzamide class. It is used in several countries for the management of agitation and aggressiveness in elderly patients, acute alcohol withdrawal, and certain movement disorders such as chorea in Huntington’s disease and dyskinesias in Parkinson’s disease. Tiapride selectively antagonizes dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, with minimal affinity for other receptor types, which contributes to a relatively favorable side effect profile compared to older antipsychotics. It is not approved for use in the United States.",
