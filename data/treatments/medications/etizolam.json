  "summary": "A thienodiazepine with anxiolytic, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties, used in some countries for anxiety and insomnia.",
  "description": "Etizolam is a thienodiazepine derivative structurally related to benzodiazepines. It acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, producing anxiolytic, hypnotic, sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects. It is approved for short-term treatment of anxiety and insomnia in certain countries, such as Japan and Italy, but is not approved in the United States. It is sometimes encountered as a research chemical or in illicit markets.",
