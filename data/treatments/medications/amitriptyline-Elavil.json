  "summary": "A tricyclic antidepressant used for depression, chronic pain, migraine prevention, and certain anxiety disorders.",
  "description": "Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing their synaptic concentrations. It also has significant anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and alpha-adrenergic blocking properties, contributing to its side effect profile. Once widely prescribed for depression, it is now more commonly used at lower doses for chronic neuropathic pain, migraine prophylaxis, and insomnia.",
