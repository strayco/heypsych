  "summary": "Piracetam is a nootropic compound of the racetam family, used primarily to enhance cognitive function and, in some countries, to treat neurological disorders such as dementia, cognitive decline, and myoclonus.",
  "description": "Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but does not act directly on GABA receptors. Instead, it is thought to modulate neurotransmission, enhance neuronal membrane fluidity, and improve microcirculation in the brain. It has been studied for use in cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, stroke recovery, and myoclonus. Although widely used in some countries, piracetam is not FDA-approved in the United States and is considered a supplement or research chemical there.",
