  "summary": "A tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) primarily used for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with additional efficacy in depression and anxiety disorders.",
  "description": "Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that strongly inhibits serotonin reuptake and, to a lesser extent, norepinephrine reuptake. It is considered one of the most effective medications for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is also used for depression, panic disorder, and certain chronic pain conditions. Due to its anticholinergic and cardiac side effects, clomipramine is generally reserved for cases where SSRIs are ineffective.",
