  "description": "Methaqualone is a quinazolinone-class sedative-hypnotic drug that was introduced in the 1960s as a treatment for insomnia and anxiety. It became widely misused as a recreational drug in the 1970s under the brand name Quaalude, known for producing euphoria, relaxation, and disinhibition. Due to its high potential for abuse, dependence, and overdose, it was withdrawn from the market in most countries by the mid-1980s and classified as a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States.",
