  "summary": "Oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant used to treat partial seizures in adults and children, and is also used off-label for bipolar disorder and neuropathic pain.",
  "description": "Oxcarbazepine is a dibenzazepine derivative structurally related to carbamazepine, but with a different metabolic profile that leads to fewer drug interactions and a lower risk of certain side effects. It blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing hyperexcited neuronal membranes and inhibiting repetitive neuronal firing. It is metabolized to its active monohydroxy derivative (MHD) and is available in both immediate-release and extended-release forms.",
