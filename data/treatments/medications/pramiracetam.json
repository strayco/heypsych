  "summary": "Pramiracetam is a synthetic nootropic of the racetam family, used to enhance memory, learning, and cognitive performance. It is more potent than piracetam and has a distinct pharmacological profile.",
  "description": "Pramiracetam is a fat-soluble racetam derivative developed in the late 1970s. It is thought to work primarily by enhancing high-affinity choline uptake, thereby increasing acetylcholine synthesis and availability in the hippocampus. This mechanism is believed to underlie its effects on learning and memory. Pramiracetam is not FDA-approved in the United States but is prescribed in some European countries for cognitive decline, dementia, and brain injury recovery.",
