  "description": "Methohexital is a barbiturate with ultra–short duration of action, primarily used for induction of anesthesia and procedural sedation. In psychiatry, it has been used in the past as an anesthetic agent during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) due to its rapid onset and recovery profile. It acts by enhancing GABA-A receptor activity, producing CNS depression.",
