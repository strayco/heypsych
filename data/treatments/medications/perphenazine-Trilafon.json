  "summary": "Perphenazine, sold under the brand name Trilafon, is a typical antipsychotic medication used primarily to treat schizophrenia and severe nausea and vomiting.",
  "description": "Perphenazine is a mid-potency typical antipsychotic in the phenothiazine class. It is effective for controlling symptoms of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other psychoses. It works mainly as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist in the central nervous system, reducing positive psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Perphenazine is also used for controlling severe nausea and vomiting. Its mid-potency profile gives it a balance between sedation and extrapyramidal side effect risks compared to low- and high-potency phenothiazines.",
