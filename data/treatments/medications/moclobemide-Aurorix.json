  "description": "Moclobemide is a reversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). It increases the levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain by inhibiting their breakdown. It is primarily indicated for major depressive disorder and social anxiety disorder, and is generally associated with fewer dietary restrictions compared to irreversible MAOIs.",
