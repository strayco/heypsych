  "summary": "Zonisamide is an antiepileptic drug used to treat partial-onset seizures in adults, with additional off-label use for other seizure types.",
  "description": "Zonisamide, marketed under the brand name Zonegran, is a sulfonamide derivative anticonvulsant indicated for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy. It is thought to exert its effects through multiple mechanisms, including blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels, reduction of T-type calcium currents, and modulation of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. Zonisamide also exhibits carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity. Due to its sulfonamide structure, it may cause hypersensitivity reactions and should be avoided in patients with sulfonamide allergy.",
