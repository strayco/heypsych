  "description": "Trifluoperazine, marketed under the brand name Stelazine, is a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic belonging to the phenothiazine class. It is primarily used in the treatment of schizophrenia and, at lower doses, for the short-term management of severe anxiety unresponsive to other treatments. Its primary mechanism is dopamine D2 receptor antagonism in the brain, which reduces psychotic symptoms but can also cause extrapyramidal side effects.",
