  "description": "Symbyax is a combination medication containing fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic. It is FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. By combining antidepressant and antipsychotic mechanisms, Symbyax addresses both mood and psychotic symptoms in certain patients. It is available in fixed-dose capsules with varying ratios of fluoxetine and olanzapine.",
