  "summary": "An opioid antagonist used to rapidly reverse opioid overdose.",
  "description": "Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that competitively binds to opioid receptors, displacing opioid molecules and reversing their effects. It is most commonly used in emergency situations to treat life-threatening respiratory depression due to opioid overdose. It can be administered intranasally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intravenously.",
