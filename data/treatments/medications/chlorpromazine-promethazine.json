  "summary": "A combination of a first-generation antipsychotic (chlorpromazine) and an antihistamine (promethazine), historically used for sedation, agitation, and nausea.",
  "description": "This combination pairs chlorpromazine, a phenothiazine antipsychotic with sedative properties, and promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative with strong antihistaminic and antiemetic effects. Historically, it has been used in psychiatry for rapid tranquilization in acute agitation, as well as in medical settings for severe nausea, vomiting, and perioperative sedation. Due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives, its psychiatric use has largely declined.",
