  "summary": "An SNRI used to treat major depressive disorder by inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.",
  "description": "Desvenlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. It is the primary active metabolite of venlafaxine and is thought to provide more predictable pharmacokinetics, especially in patients with variations in CYP2D6 metabolism. It works by increasing levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, which helps improve mood and alleviate depressive symptoms.",
