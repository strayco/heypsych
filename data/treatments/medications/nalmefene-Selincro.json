  "summary": "An opioid receptor modulator used primarily to reduce alcohol consumption in adults with alcohol dependence.",
  "description": "Nalmefene is an opioid receptor modulator with antagonist activity at the mu- and delta-opioid receptors and partial agonist activity at the kappa-opioid receptor. It is primarily indicated for the reduction of alcohol consumption in adults with alcohol dependence who have a high drinking risk level but do not require immediate detoxification. Unlike naltrexone, nalmefene is often taken on an as-needed basis rather than daily.",
