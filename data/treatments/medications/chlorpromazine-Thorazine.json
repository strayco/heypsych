  "description": "Chlorpromazine is a low-potency, first-generation (typical) antipsychotic of the phenothiazine class. It was the first antipsychotic introduced into psychiatry and remains in use for treating schizophrenia, acute mania, severe agitation, and psychosis. It also has antiemetic, antihistaminic, and anticholinergic properties, making it useful in other conditions such as severe nausea, intractable hiccups, and tetanus. Due to its sedative and hypotensive effects, it is sometimes selected for highly agitated patients requiring calming.",
