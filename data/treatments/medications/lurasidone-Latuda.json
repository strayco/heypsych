  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used for schizophrenia and bipolar depression.",
  "description": "Lurasidone is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic that primarily acts as a dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, with additional activity at 5-HT7 and 5-HT1A receptors. It is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents, as well as bipolar depression (monotherapy or adjunctive with lithium/valproate) in adults and pediatric patients. It has a relatively favorable metabolic side effect profile compared to some other atypical antipsychotics.",
