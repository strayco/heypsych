  "summary": "Periciazine is a typical antipsychotic medication primarily used to manage schizophrenia and severe behavioral disturbances.",
  "description": "Periciazine is a piperidine phenothiazine derivative with antipsychotic and sedative properties. It works mainly by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain, thereby reducing psychotic symptoms and excessive behavioral activity. It also exhibits alpha-adrenergic and anticholinergic blocking effects. It is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, other psychoses, and severe agitation or aggression in patients with mental illness or intellectual disability.",
