  "summary": "Suvorexant (Belsomra) is an orexin receptor antagonist used to treat insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance.",
  "description": "Suvorexant, marketed under the brand name Belsomra, is an oral dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) that promotes sleep by inhibiting the wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and B from binding to their receptors OX1R and OX2R. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia in adults who have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Unlike traditional sedative-hypnotics that enhance GABA activity, suvorexant targets the sleep-wake regulation system, which may result in a different side effect profile. It is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the U.S. due to its potential for abuse and dependence.",
