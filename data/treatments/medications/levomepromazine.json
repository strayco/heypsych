  "description": "Levomepromazine (also known as methotrimeprazine) is a phenothiazine derivative classified as a low-potency typical antipsychotic. It has strong sedative, antihistaminic, anticholinergic, and alpha-adrenergic blocking effects. It is used in psychiatry for schizophrenia and other psychoses, but more commonly in palliative care for managing pain, agitation, and nausea/vomiting.",
