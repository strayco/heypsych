  "summary": "Tasimelteon (Hetlioz) is a melatonin receptor agonist used to treat non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder and nighttime sleep disturbances in Smith-Magenis syndrome.",
  "description": "Tasimelteon, marketed under the brand name Hetlioz, is an oral melatonin receptor agonist that selectively binds to MT1 and MT2 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (Non-24) in totally blind adults and nighttime sleep disturbances in patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) aged 3 years and older. By acting on the body’s internal clock, tasimelteon helps regulate circadian rhythms and improve sleep timing and quality. It is generally well tolerated but may cause side effects such as headache, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal dreams.",
