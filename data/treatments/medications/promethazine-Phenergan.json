  "summary": "Promethazine is a first-generation antihistamine with strong sedative, antiemetic, and anticholinergic effects, used for allergies, nausea/vomiting, motion sickness, and pre/postoperative sedation.",
  "description": "Promethazine, sold under the brand name Phenergan among others, is a phenothiazine derivative with potent H1 receptor antagonism, producing antihistamine and sedative effects. It also has antiemetic, anticholinergic, and moderate dopaminergic antagonist activity. It is indicated for the treatment of allergic conditions, prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting (including motion sickness), preoperative sedation, and as an adjunct in analgesia. Due to its strong sedative and respiratory depressant effects, it must be used with caution, especially in young children and elderly patients.",
