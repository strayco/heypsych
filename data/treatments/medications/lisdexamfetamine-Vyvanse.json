  "summary": "A prodrug stimulant used to treat ADHD and binge eating disorder in adults.",
  "description": "Lisdexamfetamine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and a prodrug of dextroamphetamine. It is approved for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in patients aged 6 years and older and for moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED) in adults. Its prodrug formulation provides a smoother onset and longer duration of effect compared to immediate-release stimulants, reducing the risk of misuse.",
