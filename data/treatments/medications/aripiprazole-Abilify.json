  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression augmentation, and other psychiatric conditions.",
  "description": "Aripiprazole is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic that acts as a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. It is used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder, and for irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder. It is available in oral, orally disintegrating, and long-acting injectable formulations.",
