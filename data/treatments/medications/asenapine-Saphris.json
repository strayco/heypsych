  "description": "Asenapine is an atypical antipsychotic approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and for acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults and pediatric patients aged 10–17 years. It has high affinity for multiple serotonin, dopamine, alpha-adrenergic, and histamine receptors, and is administered sublingually or via transdermal patch to avoid extensive first-pass metabolism.",
