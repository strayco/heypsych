  "description": "Levetiracetam is an anticonvulsant that binds to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), modulating neurotransmitter release and reducing neuronal excitability. It is FDA-approved for seizure disorders but has been used off-label in psychiatry for mood stabilization, aggression, and behavioral dysregulation, particularly in neurological conditions.",
