  "summary": "A selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist used to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.",
  "description": "Ondansetron is an antiemetic that works by blocking serotonin (5-HT3) receptors both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. It is effective for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and postoperative recovery. It is available in oral, orally disintegrating tablet (ODT), and injectable forms.",
