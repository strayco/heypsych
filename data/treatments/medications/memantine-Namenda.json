  "description": "Memantine is an uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that modulates the effects of glutamate, a neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory. Excessive activation of NMDA receptors is thought to contribute to neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is approved for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease and is sometimes used in combination with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.",
