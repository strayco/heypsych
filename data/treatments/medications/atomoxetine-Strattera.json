  "summary": "A selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) approved for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults.",
  "description": "Atomoxetine is a non-stimulant medication for ADHD that selectively inhibits the norepinephrine transporter, increasing norepinephrine levels in the prefrontal cortex. Unlike stimulant medications, it is not a controlled substance and has a lower risk of misuse. It may take several weeks to achieve full therapeutic benefit. It is often preferred in patients with comorbid anxiety, tic disorders, or a history of substance misuse.",
