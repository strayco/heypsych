  "description": "Bupropion SR (Zyban) is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) approved for smoking cessation and also used as an antidepressant. Unlike SSRIs, it has minimal sexual side effects and may aid in energy and concentration. In smoking cessation, it reduces nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. The sustained-release (SR) formulation allows twice-daily dosing.",
