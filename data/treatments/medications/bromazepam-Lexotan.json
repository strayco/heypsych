  "description": "Bromazepam is a benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, sedative, and muscle relaxant properties. It is prescribed for the short-term relief of anxiety and tension, and in some cases as a premedication before surgical or diagnostic procedures. It is not approved in the United States but is widely used in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Like other benzodiazepines, bromazepam carries a risk of dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms.",
