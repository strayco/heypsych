  "summary": "A synthetic nootropic compound in the racetam family, used for potential cognitive enhancement and studied for mood and neuroprotective effects.",
  "description": "Aniracetam is a fat-soluble nootropic drug structurally related to piracetam. It is believed to modulate AMPA-type glutamate receptors and enhance cholinergic neurotransmission. It has been studied for cognitive enhancement, anxiety reduction, and neuroprotection, but evidence in humans is limited and it is not approved for medical use in the United States. It is available in some countries as a prescription drug for cognitive impairment and dementia.",
