  "summary": "Perampanel is an oral antiepileptic medication used to treat partial-onset seizures and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures.",
  "description": "Perampanel, marketed under the brand name Fycompa, is a selective, noncompetitive antagonist of the AMPA receptor, a subtype of the glutamate receptor in the central nervous system. By inhibiting excitatory neurotransmission mediated by AMPA receptors, perampanel reduces neuronal hyperexcitability associated with seizures. It is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients aged 4 years and older, and for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients aged 12 years and older.",
