  "summary": "A tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) used for depression, anxiety, and certain childhood enuresis cases.",
  "description": "Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, increasing their levels in the brain. It is indicated for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and as a second-line treatment for nocturnal enuresis in children. Due to its anticholinergic and cardiotoxic potential, monitoring is essential, especially in older adults.",
