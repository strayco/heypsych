  "summary": "Vilazodone is an antidepressant used for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.",
  "description": "Vilazodone, marketed under the brand name Viibryd, is an oral antidepressant that combines selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI) with partial agonist activity at the 5-HT1A receptor. This dual mechanism is thought to increase serotonergic activity in the brain and improve mood regulation. It is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults and is generally taken once daily with food to improve absorption.",
