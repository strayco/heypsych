  "description": "Aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada) is a long-acting intramuscular atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. It is a prodrug that is converted to aripiprazole after injection, providing sustained therapeutic levels for 4–8 weeks depending on dose. Its mechanism involves partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.",
