  "summary": "An atypical antipsychotic used primarily in East Asia for the treatment of schizophrenia, with dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A antagonism.",
  "description": "Blonanserin is an atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic approved in Japan, South Korea, and China for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has a high affinity for dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, with relatively lower affinity for histamine H1 and muscarinic receptors, which may result in a lower risk of sedation and anticholinergic effects compared to some other atypicals. Limited evidence suggests it may also be effective for bipolar disorder and other psychotic conditions, but its use is largely region-specific.",
