  "summary": "Phenelzine, sold under the brand name Nardil, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) used primarily for the treatment of major depressive disorder, especially atypical depression, and certain anxiety disorders.",
  "description": "Phenelzine is a non-selective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that increases levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain by blocking their breakdown. It is typically reserved for patients who have not responded to other antidepressants due to its dietary restrictions and drug interaction risks. Phenelzine is effective in treating atypical depression, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder.",
