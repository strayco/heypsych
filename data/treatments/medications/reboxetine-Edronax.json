  "description": "Reboxetine is an antidepressant that selectively inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine, increasing its availability in the synaptic cleft. It is mainly used for major depressive disorder and may have applications in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and certain anxiety disorders. Unlike SSRIs, it has minimal effects on serotonin reuptake.",
