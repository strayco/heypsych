  "summary": "A traditional herbal remedy widely used for anxiety, insomnia, and digestive discomfort, supported by some clinical evidence for mild-to-moderate anxiety and sleep improvement.",
  "description": "Chamomile is one of the most commonly used medicinal herbs worldwide, prepared as teas, extracts, or essential oils. It contains bioactive compounds such as apigenin, luteolin, and bisabolol, which contribute to its anxiolytic, sedative, anti-inflammatory, and gastrointestinal-calming properties. Clinical studies suggest benefits in mild-to-moderate generalized anxiety disorder, sleep quality, and gastrointestinal health. Chamomile is generally well tolerated but may cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the Asteraceae family. It can also interact with anticoagulants and sedatives.",
