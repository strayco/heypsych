  "description": "Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor) is a widely distributed medicinal mushroom traditionally used in Asian medicine. It contains bioactive compounds such as polysaccharopeptide (PSP) and polysaccharide-K (PSK), which have immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and prebiotic properties. Clinical studies, particularly in Japan and China, have investigated PSK as an adjunctive cancer therapy with evidence of improved survival in some cancers. Turkey Tail is also studied for supporting gut microbiome health, immune function, and resilience against infections, though more high-quality human trials are needed.",
