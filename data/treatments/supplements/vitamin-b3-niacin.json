  "summary": "Vitamin B3, also known as niacin, is an essential water-soluble vitamin important for energy metabolism, cardiovascular health, and skin integrity.",
  "description": "Niacin (Vitamin B3) exists in two main forms, nicotinic acid and nicotinamide (niacinamide). Both are precursors to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺/NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP⁺/NADPH), essential coenzymes in cellular metabolism, DNA repair, and antioxidant defense. Niacin plays a key role in energy production, maintaining healthy skin, nerves, and digestion. High-dose niacin (nicotinic acid) has been used clinically to manage dyslipidemia, as it lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while raising HDL cholesterol. Niacinamide is more often used in dermatology and supplementation, as it does not cause flushing. Deficiency results in pellagra, characterized by the “3 Ds”: dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia.",
