  "summary": "Multi-strain probiotics combine different beneficial bacterial species to support gut health, immune balance, and potentially mood regulation. They may have synergistic effects on gastrointestinal and mental health outcomes compared to single-strain probiotics.",
  "description": "Multi-strain probiotics contain a combination of various beneficial bacteria, often including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and sometimes Streptococcus or Saccharomyces species. These supplements are designed to enhance microbial diversity, restore gut microbiome balance, and influence systemic health through the gut-brain axis. While single-strain probiotics have demonstrated targeted benefits, multi-strain formulations may provide broader or synergistic effects, including potential benefits for mood, anxiety, cognition, and immune function. They are widely available as dietary supplements and commonly used in integrative psychiatry.",
