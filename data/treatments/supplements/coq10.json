  "description": "Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone, ubiquinol) is a naturally occurring compound in the electron transport chain that plays a key role in ATP production and cellular energy metabolism. As both an antioxidant and mitochondrial cofactor, it has been investigated in cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and psychiatric conditions. Emerging evidence suggests possible benefits for depression, chronic fatigue, and mitochondrial dysfunction–related syndromes. It is generally safe and well tolerated.",
