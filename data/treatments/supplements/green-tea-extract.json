  "summary": "Green tea extract, rich in catechins such as EGCG, is studied for its antioxidant, metabolic, and neuroprotective properties, with potential benefits in mood, cognition, and weight regulation.",
  "description": "Green tea extract is derived from the leaves of Camellia sinensis and contains concentrated polyphenols, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). These bioactive compounds exert strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, modulate neurotransmitter activity, and improve metabolic function. Green tea extract has been investigated for its potential in supporting cognitive health, reducing stress and anxiety, and promoting weight management. It is commonly used in integrative and preventive medicine for its cardiometabolic and neuroprotective benefits.",
