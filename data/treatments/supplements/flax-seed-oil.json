  "summary": "Flax seed oil is a plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), used for cardiovascular, metabolic, and general health support.",
  "description": "Flax seed oil is extracted from the seeds of the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum). It is one of the richest plant sources of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential omega-3 fatty acid that the body can partially convert into EPA and DHA, though conversion efficiency is low. Flax seed oil is commonly used to support heart health, reduce inflammation, and improve skin and digestive health. Compared to fish oil, it is often chosen by vegetarians and vegans as a plant-based alternative, though its efficacy in psychiatric or neurological disorders is less established.",
