  "summary": "NAD⁺ precursors such as nicotinamide riboside (NR), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and niacinamide are supplements that aim to increase cellular NAD⁺ levels, supporting energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and healthy aging.",
  "description": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) is a coenzyme essential for energy production, DNA repair, and cellular signaling. NAD⁺ levels decline with age and stress, which has been linked to fatigue, metabolic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and mood disorders. Supplementing with NAD⁺ precursors such as nicotinamide riboside (NR), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), niacinamide, or niacin may help restore NAD⁺ availability. Preclinical studies suggest benefits for mitochondrial health, resilience to stress, and neuroprotection, though large-scale human psychiatric trials remain limited.",
