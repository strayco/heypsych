  "description": "Lactobacillus rhamnosus is a probiotic bacterium widely used in dietary supplements and functional foods. The best-studied strain, *L. rhamnosus GG* (ATCC 53103), has been linked to gut health, immune modulation, and possible effects on stress resilience, anxiety, and mood regulation. Animal studies suggest mechanisms involving γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor modulation and vagus nerve signaling. Early human studies indicate potential benefits for stress and anxiety, though clinical evidence is still limited and strain-specific.",
