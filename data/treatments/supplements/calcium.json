  "summary": "An essential mineral for bone health, muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and cardiovascular stability, sometimes used as adjunctive support in mood and anxiety disorders.",
  "description": "Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body, with over 99% stored in bones and teeth. It plays critical roles in skeletal integrity, neuromuscular function, intracellular signaling, and blood clotting. While primarily recognized for preventing osteoporosis, calcium has also been studied in psychiatry, particularly in relation to premenstrual syndrome (PMS), mood regulation, and anxiety. Supplementation is widely available but should be balanced with other minerals, particularly magnesium and vitamin D, to optimize absorption and minimize cardiovascular risks.",
