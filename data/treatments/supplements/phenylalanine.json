  "summary": "Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid and precursor to neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, with potential applications in mood regulation, pain management, and cognitive health.",
  "description": "Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid obtained through dietary protein and supplements. It exists in three forms: L-phenylalanine (naturally occurring and proteinogenic), D-phenylalanine (a synthetic form with potential analgesic properties), and DL-phenylalanine (a mixture of both, used in mood and pain support). Phenylalanine serves as a precursor to tyrosine, which in turn contributes to the synthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These pathways make it a target of interest in conditions involving low mood, attention deficits, and chronic pain. However, its use requires caution, especially in individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU).",
