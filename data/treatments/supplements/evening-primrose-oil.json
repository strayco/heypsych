  "summary": "Evening primrose oil (EPO) is a plant-based supplement rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid believed to support skin health, reduce inflammation, and potentially improve mood and premenstrual symptoms.",
  "description": "Evening primrose oil is extracted from the seeds of the evening primrose plant (Oenothera biennis). It contains gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a precursor to anti-inflammatory prostaglandins. EPO has been studied for a wide range of conditions, including eczema, mastalgia, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), menopause-related symptoms, and mood regulation. While evidence is mixed, some studies suggest benefits for women’s health and mild anti-inflammatory effects. It is widely available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement.",
