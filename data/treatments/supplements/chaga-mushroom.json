  "summary": "A medicinal fungus traditionally used in Siberian and Eastern European folk medicine, studied for its antioxidant, immune-modulating, and anti-inflammatory effects.",
  "description": "Chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) grows primarily on birch trees in cold climates. It has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to boost vitality, improve immune function, and reduce inflammation. Modern research suggests Chaga may have neuroprotective and adaptogenic effects due to its high content of antioxidants (such as polyphenols, melanin, and triterpenes). While preclinical studies highlight potential benefits in reducing oxidative stress, modulating immunity, and supporting gut and brain health, robust clinical trials in psychiatric or neurological disorders are limited. Safety appears good, though Chaga is high in oxalates and may pose risks for kidney health in some individuals.",
