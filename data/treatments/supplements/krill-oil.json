  "summary": "Krill oil is a marine-derived supplement rich in omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) bound to phospholipids, along with astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant. It is investigated for cardiovascular, cognitive, mood, and inflammatory health benefits.",
  "description": "Krill oil is extracted from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), tiny crustaceans that are a major food source for marine animals. Unlike fish oil, the omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil are primarily bound to phospholipids, which may improve absorption and bioavailability. Krill oil also contains astaxanthin, an antioxidant carotenoid that contributes to its stability and potential neuroprotective effects. It has been studied for cardiovascular health, cognitive function, inflammation, and mood disorders, including depression and anxiety. While generally safe, krill oil can cause gastrointestinal side effects and should be used with caution in individuals with shellfish allergies or those taking anticoagulants.",
