  "summary": "Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid that supports gut health, immune function, and may play a role in stress response and mental health.",
  "description": "Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body and serves as a critical fuel source for rapidly dividing cells, including those in the immune system and the gastrointestinal tract. It is also a precursor for neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA, which are essential for brain function and mood regulation. While commonly used in sports nutrition and recovery, glutamine supplementation has also been investigated for its role in reducing stress-related gut permeability, supporting immune health, and aiding in mood stabilization. Evidence in psychiatric applications remains limited and largely experimental.",
