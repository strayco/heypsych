  "summary": "Vitamin B7, commonly known as biotin, is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin that supports fatty acid synthesis, glucose metabolism, and amino acid breakdown. It is often marketed for hair, skin, and nail health.",
  "description": "Biotin is an essential coenzyme for carboxylase enzymes involved in critical metabolic pathways, including fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Although true biotin deficiency is rare, it can cause symptoms such as hair loss, brittle nails, dermatitis, neurological disturbances, and developmental delays in infants. Biotin supplementation is commonly marketed for cosmetic benefits such as hair and nail strength, although clinical evidence for these effects in healthy individuals is limited. High-dose biotin may interfere with certain laboratory tests, including thyroid function and troponin assays.",
