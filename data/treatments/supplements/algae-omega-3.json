  "description": "Algae-derived omega-3 supplements provide docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and, in some formulations, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These fatty acids are essential for brain development, neuronal membrane fluidity, anti-inflammatory pathways, and cardiovascular health. Unlike fish oil, algae oil offers a sustainable, vegan-friendly alternative with lower risk of heavy metal contamination. Research suggests that adequate DHA/EPA intake may reduce depression risk, support cognitive health, and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Trials in perinatal mental health also suggest potential benefits in reducing perinatal depression risk.",
