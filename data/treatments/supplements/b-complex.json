  "summary": "A group of eight essential B vitamins that support energy metabolism, neurological health, and stress resilience.",
  "description": "B-complex refers to the eight water-soluble B vitamins—B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B7 (biotin), B9 (folate), and B12 (cobalamin). These vitamins serve as cofactors in critical enzymatic reactions for energy production, neurotransmitter synthesis, red blood cell formation, and DNA repair. Supplementation may help address deficiencies caused by poor diet, alcoholism, medication use, or certain health conditions. B vitamins are also investigated for their roles in mood regulation, cognitive function, and stress resilience.",
