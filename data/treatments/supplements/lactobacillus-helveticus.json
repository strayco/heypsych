  "summary": "Lactobacillus helveticus is a probiotic strain studied for its potential mental health benefits, particularly in reducing anxiety, stress, and supporting cognitive health via the gut-brain axis.",
  "description": "Lactobacillus helveticus is a lactic acid–producing bacterial strain commonly found in fermented dairy products and used as a probiotic supplement. Emerging research suggests that certain strains, especially when combined with *Bifidobacterium longum*, may reduce psychological stress, improve mood, and modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Proposed mechanisms include modulation of gut microbiota composition, reduction of gut permeability, and production of neuroactive compounds influencing neurotransmission. While promising, evidence is preliminary, and effects are strain-specific.",
