  "summary": "Selenium is an essential trace mineral with antioxidant properties, important for thyroid function, immune health, and cellular protection.",
  "description": "Selenium is a trace element required for the synthesis of selenoproteins, which play critical roles in antioxidant defense, thyroid hormone metabolism, and immune regulation. Dietary selenium comes from plant and animal sources, with levels depending on soil selenium content. Adequate selenium intake helps protect cells from oxidative stress, supports normal thyroid function, and maintains a healthy immune response. Deficiency can impair immunity and thyroid activity, while excess supplementation can cause toxicity. Selenium has also been studied for its potential roles in cancer prevention, mood regulation, and cognitive health, though evidence is mixed.",
