  "summary": "Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that protects cell membranes from oxidative stress. It exists in multiple forms, with alpha-tocopherol being the most biologically active in humans.",
  "description": "Vitamin E is a collective term for eight fat-soluble compounds: four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) and four tocotrienols. Alpha-tocopherol is the predominant and most active form in human tissues. Vitamin E functions primarily as an antioxidant, protecting cell membranes, lipids, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from free radical damage. It also has roles in immune function, gene expression, and cell signaling. Supplementation is mainly used to correct deficiency (rare) or investigated for its potential benefits in cardiovascular health, eye health, neurodegenerative disorders, and skin conditions, though evidence for disease prevention is mixed.",
