  "summary": "Vitamin B9, known as folate in its natural form and folic acid in its synthetic form, is an essential water-soluble B vitamin required for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, as well as red blood cell formation.",
  "description": "Folate plays a key role in one-carbon metabolism, supporting nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation reactions. Deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia, elevated homocysteine, and in pregnancy, an increased risk of neural tube defects. Supplementation with folic acid is routinely recommended for women of childbearing potential. Folate may also support cardiovascular health, cognition, and mood regulation through its role in neurotransmitter synthesis. However, excessive folic acid intake may mask vitamin B12 deficiency.",
