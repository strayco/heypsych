  "summary": "Phosphorus is an essential mineral involved in bone health, cellular energy production, and neurotransmission, though supplementation is rarely needed outside of deficiency.",
  "description": "Phosphorus is the second most abundant mineral in the human body after calcium, with approximately 85% stored in bones and teeth as hydroxyapatite. It plays critical roles in energy metabolism (as ATP and phosphocreatine), cell signaling, acid-base balance, and neuronal function. Because phosphorus is widely available in the diet (meat, dairy, legumes, nuts, grains), deficiencies are uncommon except in cases of malnutrition, chronic alcoholism, or certain medical conditions. Supplementation may be considered in hypophosphatemia or specific clinical scenarios, but excessive intake can be harmful, particularly in kidney disease. Phosphorus supplements are generally used under medical supervision.",
