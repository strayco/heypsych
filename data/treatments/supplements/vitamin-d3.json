  "summary": "Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the animal-derived form of vitamin D, synthesized in the skin from sunlight and commonly used in supplements. It is more effective than D2 in raising and maintaining serum vitamin D levels.",
  "description": "Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble secosteroid that plays a vital role in calcium and phosphate balance, bone mineralization, muscle function, and immune regulation. It is synthesized in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) light and is also obtained from dietary sources like fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified foods. Compared to vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), D3 is more potent and maintains higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Supplementation with D3 is the preferred choice for preventing and treating deficiency, supporting bone and muscle health, and potentially modulating immune and mood-related conditions.",
