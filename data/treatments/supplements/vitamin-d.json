  "summary": "Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone health, and immune function. Its main forms are D2 (ergocalciferol, plant-derived) and D3 (cholecalciferol, synthesized in skin or from animal sources).",
  "description": "Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption, bone mineralization, and maintaining serum calcium and phosphorus levels. It also influences muscle function, immune regulation, and cell differentiation. Vitamin D can be obtained from sunlight exposure, diet, or supplements. Deficiency is common and can cause rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults, and contribute to osteoporosis. Supplementation is used to prevent and treat deficiency, with emerging research on roles in immunity, cardiovascular health, mood disorders, and cancer prevention.",
