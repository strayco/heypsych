  "summary": "Kava is a traditional South Pacific plant-based supplement used for its calming, anxiolytic, and sleep-promoting properties. Its active compounds, kavalactones, modulate neurotransmission to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation.",
  "description": "Kava, derived from the root of the Piper methysticum plant, has been consumed ceremonially in Pacific Island cultures for centuries as a calming and social beverage. Its bioactive compounds, known as kavalactones, influence GABAergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic pathways to reduce anxiety and induce relaxation. Modern use focuses on anxiety relief, sleep support, and stress reduction. While generally effective, kava has been associated with rare but serious hepatotoxicity, leading to restrictions or warnings in several countries.",
