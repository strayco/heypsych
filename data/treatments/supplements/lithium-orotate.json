  "summary": "Lithium orotate is a dietary supplement form of lithium, sometimes promoted for mood stabilization, anxiety, and neuroprotection, though clinical evidence is limited.",
  "description": "Lithium orotate is a salt of lithium and orotic acid, available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. Unlike prescription lithium carbonate or citrate, which are FDA-approved for bipolar disorder and mood stabilization, lithium orotate has not been approved for any psychiatric condition. Advocates claim it may deliver lithium more efficiently at lower doses, but this has not been conclusively demonstrated. Some preliminary evidence and case reports suggest potential benefits for mood stabilization, impulse control, and neuroprotection. However, safety concerns remain, as lithium—even at low doses—can accumulate and affect kidney and thyroid function.",
