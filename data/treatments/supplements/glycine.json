  "summary": "Glycine is a non-essential amino acid that functions as both a neurotransmitter and a metabolic regulator, studied for its roles in sleep, cognition, metabolic health, and adjunctive psychiatric treatment.",
  "description": "Glycine is the simplest amino acid and serves as a key building block for proteins, glutathione, creatine, and collagen. In the central nervous system, it functions as both an inhibitory neurotransmitter (especially in the spinal cord and brainstem) and as a co-agonist at NMDA receptors, modulating glutamatergic transmission. Supplemental glycine has been studied for improving sleep quality, reducing core body temperature before sleep, enhancing cognitive function, and as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. It also plays roles in metabolic regulation, stress response, and antioxidant defense.",
