  "description": "Citicoline (cytidine-5’-diphosphocholine, or CDP-choline) is a dietary supplement and intermediate in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a key component of neuronal membranes. It has been researched as a neuroprotective agent in stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative conditions. In psychiatry, citicoline is being studied for its effects on attention, working memory, and impulse control, with emerging evidence in ADHD, substance use disorders, and cognitive impairment. It is generally well tolerated, with minimal side effects.",
