  "summary": "Prebiotic fibers are nondigestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, supporting gut health, immune balance, and potentially influencing mood and cognition.",
  "description": "Prebiotic fibers, such as inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galactooligosaccharides (GOS), resist digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and serve as substrates for beneficial gut microbiota. By enhancing the growth of commensal bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, they improve gut barrier function, modulate immune activity, and contribute to production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate. These metabolites support gut and systemic health, influence metabolic processes, and may impact brain function via the gut–brain axis. Prebiotic supplementation is commonly used for digestive health, constipation relief, and overall microbiome support, with emerging interest in psychiatric and stress-related conditions.",
