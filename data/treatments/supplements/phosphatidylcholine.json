  "summary": "Phosphatidylcholine is a major phospholipid component of cell membranes and a source of choline, supporting liver health, cognitive function, and cell membrane integrity.",
  "description": "Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a naturally occurring phospholipid found in high concentrations in soybeans, eggs, sunflower seeds, and other foods. It serves as a key source of choline, an essential nutrient required for acetylcholine synthesis, membrane repair, and lipid metabolism. Supplementation has been studied for supporting liver health (including fatty liver disease and hepatoprotection), enhancing cognitive function, and improving cell membrane stability. While widely available as a dietary supplement, clinical evidence for psychiatric and cognitive indications remains preliminary. PC is often used in functional medicine and integrative approaches for detoxification and metabolic support.",
