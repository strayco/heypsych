  "summary": "Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) is a herbal supplement commonly used for urinary and prostate health, particularly in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).",
  "description": "Saw palmetto is derived from the berries of the Serenoa repens palm tree, native to the southeastern United States. It has traditionally been used to support urinary tract and reproductive health in men. The extract is thought to work by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase, an enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which plays a role in prostate growth. While saw palmetto is widely used for symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), clinical trial evidence is mixed. Some studies suggest modest benefit in reducing urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia, while others show minimal effects compared to placebo. It is generally well tolerated and is also marketed for hair loss, though evidence remains limited.",
