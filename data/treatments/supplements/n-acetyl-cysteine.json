  "description": "N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is a derivative of the amino acid cysteine and a well-established mucolytic agent and antidote for acetaminophen overdose. In psychiatry and integrative medicine, NAC is increasingly studied for its role in modulating glutamate and replenishing intracellular glutathione. This makes it relevant in conditions involving oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysregulated glutamate signaling, such as depression, bipolar disorder, OCD, and substance use disorders. It is widely available as an over-the-counter supplement and has a strong safety profile at standard doses.",
