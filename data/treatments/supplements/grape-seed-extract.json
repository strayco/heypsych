  "summary": "Grape seed extract is a natural supplement rich in proanthocyanidins (OPCs), studied for its antioxidant, cardiovascular, and neuroprotective effects, with potential benefits for cognition, anxiety, and metabolic health.",
  "description": "Grape seed extract (GSE) is derived from the seeds of Vitis vinifera and contains high levels of oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs), which are potent antioxidants. These compounds protect against oxidative stress, improve vascular health, and support microcirculation. Emerging research suggests possible benefits for cognitive function, stress reduction, and adjunctive support in anxiety and metabolic disorders. GSE is commonly used in integrative medicine as a cardiometabolic and neuroprotective supplement.",
