  "description": "Cordyceps is a genus of parasitic fungi used in traditional Chinese and Tibetan medicine. The most studied species include Cordyceps sinensis (now Ophiocordyceps sinensis) and Cordyceps militaris. It is valued for its adaptogenic, immunomodulatory, and energy-boosting properties. Bioactive compounds like cordycepin and polysaccharides are thought to enhance mitochondrial function, oxygen utilization, and stress resilience. Modern research explores its role in fatigue, mood regulation, neuroprotection, and metabolic health.",
