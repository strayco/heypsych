  "summary": "Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, studied for cardiovascular, metabolic, and neuroprotective benefits, as well as potential roles in aging and mental health.",
  "description": "Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in red grapes, wine, peanuts, and certain berries. It has been widely studied for its ability to activate sirtuin pathways, particularly SIRT1, which are involved in longevity, cellular repair, and stress resistance. Preclinical studies suggest neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects, with potential applications in cognitive health, mood regulation, and metabolic disorders. However, clinical evidence remains mixed, with issues of bioavailability limiting therapeutic effectiveness.",
