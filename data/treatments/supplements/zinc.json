  "summary": "Zinc is an essential trace mineral required for immune function, wound healing, growth, reproduction, and neurological health. It plays a critical role as a cofactor for over 300 enzymes.",
  "description": "Zinc is a vital micronutrient involved in DNA synthesis, cellular repair, protein metabolism, and immune defense. It is naturally found in foods such as oysters, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts, and whole grains. Deficiency can lead to impaired immunity, delayed wound healing, growth retardation, hair loss, and depression. Supplementation is widely used for immune support, cold prevention, and skin health. Various formulations exist, including zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate, and zinc picolinate, with differing absorption profiles.",
