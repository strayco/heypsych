  "summary": "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in numerous biochemical processes, including neurotransmission and stress regulation. Various forms of magnesium are used as supplements for anxiety, depression, sleep, and overall mental health.",
  "description": "Magnesium is a vital mineral that plays roles in neuromuscular function, neurotransmitter regulation, and energy metabolism. Deficiency has been associated with depression, anxiety, migraines, and insomnia. Supplementation is common in integrative psychiatry, though clinical evidence is variable depending on formulation and condition. Different forms of magnesium vary in absorption, tolerability, and clinical effects—making the choice of formulation important for therapeutic use in mental health.",
