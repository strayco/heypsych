  "description": "Tryptophan is an essential amino acid obtained from dietary sources and is metabolized into serotonin, melatonin, and niacin (vitamin B3). It plays a key role in regulating mood, sleep-wake cycles, and stress response. Supplementation has been studied for depression, insomnia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and seasonal affective disorder, though clinical evidence varies. Its use is limited by competition with other amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier, and high doses can cause side effects. Tryptophan supplementation should be distinguished from 5-HTP, another serotonin precursor.",
