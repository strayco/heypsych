  "summary": "Oral lavender preparations, particularly standardized essential oil capsules, have been studied for their calming and anxiolytic properties, showing benefits in reducing anxiety, improving sleep, and promoting relaxation.",
  "description": "Lavender (*Lavandula angustifolia*) has a long history of use in traditional medicine for relaxation and calming. Oral forms, such as lavender oil capsules (notably standardized to contain linalool and linalyl acetate), have been clinically studied for generalized anxiety disorder, subsyndromal anxiety, and stress-related sleep disturbances. Evidence suggests lavender may modulate GABAergic neurotransmission, serotonin activity, and the autonomic nervous system. Compared to sedative medications, lavender is non-sedating and generally well tolerated, though gastrointestinal side effects can occur.",
