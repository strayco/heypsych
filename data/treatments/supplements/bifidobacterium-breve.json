  "description": "Bifidobacterium breve is a gram-positive, anaerobic probiotic bacterium commonly found in the human gut microbiome, particularly in infants. It contributes to digestive health by fermenting carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), modulating the immune system, and competing against pathogenic bacteria. It has been studied for gastrointestinal disorders, allergic diseases, metabolic syndrome, and emerging applications in psychiatry (gut–brain axis).",
