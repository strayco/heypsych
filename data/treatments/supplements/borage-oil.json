  "summary": "A seed oil rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), studied for its anti-inflammatory, dermatologic, and hormonal health benefits, with emerging evidence in mood and stress regulation.",
  "description": "Borage oil is derived from the seeds of Borago officinalis, a medicinal plant. It is one of the richest natural sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid that supports anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory pathways. Traditionally used for skin disorders such as eczema, rheumatoid arthritis, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS), borage oil has also been studied for cardiovascular and neurological support. Its role in psychiatry is emerging, particularly in adjunctive support for mood and stress regulation.",

These effects improve skin barrier function, reduce inflammation, and support hormonal balance. Preliminary research suggests GLA may also influence neuronal signaling and stress response."
