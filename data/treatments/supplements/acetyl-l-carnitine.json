  "summary": "A naturally occurring amino acid derivative involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, studied as a supplement for depression, cognitive decline, neuropathic pain, and fatigue.",
  "description": "Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is an acetylated form of L-carnitine, a compound that helps transport fatty acids into mitochondria for energy production. ALCAR readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, where it may enhance acetylcholine synthesis, support mitochondrial function, and exert neuroprotective effects. It has been investigated as a supplement for depression, age-related cognitive decline, neuropathic pain, chronic fatigue, and metabolic conditions. Evidence suggests modest benefits in depression (particularly in older adults) and neuropathic pain, though high-quality trials remain limited.",
