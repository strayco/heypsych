  "summary": "Passionflower (Passiflora incarnata) is a traditional herbal supplement used for anxiety, insomnia, and stress relief, with mild sedative and anxiolytic properties.",
  "description": "Passionflower is an herbal remedy derived from Passiflora incarnata, historically used in European and Native American medicine for nervous restlessness, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Its compounds, including flavonoids and alkaloids, are thought to modulate GABAergic neurotransmission, producing calming effects similar to benzodiazepines but generally milder. Modern clinical evidence suggests possible benefits in generalized anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, and sleep initiation, though high-quality trials remain limited. It is often used as a gentler alternative to prescription sedatives.",
