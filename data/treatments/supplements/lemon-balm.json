  "summary": "Lemon balm (*Melissa officinalis*) is an herbal supplement traditionally used for calming, stress relief, and sleep support, with emerging evidence for its anxiolytic and cognitive effects.",
  "description": "Lemon balm is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and has been used for centuries as a calming herb. Its extracts and teas are commonly taken to reduce stress, ease anxiety, and promote sleep. Bioactive compounds, including rosmarinic acid, flavonoids, and terpenes, are thought to contribute to its effects on the central nervous system, including modulation of GABA receptors. Clinical studies suggest lemon balm may improve mood, reduce restlessness, and enhance cognitive performance under stress. It is generally well tolerated, with mild side effects such as nausea or dizziness reported occasionally.",
