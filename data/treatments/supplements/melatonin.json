  "summary": "Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone produced by the pineal gland that regulates circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles. Supplementation is widely used for insomnia, jet lag, and circadian rhythm disorders.",
  "description": "Melatonin is an endogenous indoleamine synthesized from serotonin in the pineal gland, primarily secreted at night. As a supplement, it is used for sleep initiation, jet lag, shift work sleep disorder, and circadian rhythm disturbances. Beyond sleep, melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, and has been investigated in psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. It is generally considered safe, non-habit forming, and well tolerated at standard doses.",
