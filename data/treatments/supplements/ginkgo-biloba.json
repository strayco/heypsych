  "description": "Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) is one of the most widely used herbal medicines worldwide, derived from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree. It contains flavonoids, terpenoids, and other phytochemicals with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasoregulatory properties. Ginkgo is often promoted for enhancing memory, improving circulation, reducing anxiety, and treating dementia-related symptoms. While some studies suggest modest benefits in cognitive function and anxiety, large-scale clinical trials have shown inconsistent results, and its use remains controversial in evidence-based medicine. It is, however, generally regarded as safe and is among the most popular supplements for brain health.",
