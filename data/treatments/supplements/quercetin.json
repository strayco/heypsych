  "summary": "Quercetin is a plant flavonoid with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, studied for immune, cardiovascular, and potential mental health benefits.",
  "description": "Quercetin is a bioflavonoid naturally found in fruits, vegetables, tea, and red wine. It acts as a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound, modulating cellular signaling pathways, histamine release, and cytokine activity. Quercetin has been studied for its potential in supporting immune resilience, reducing allergy symptoms, improving cardiovascular health, and providing neuroprotective effects. In mental health, quercetin may influence oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial function, though psychiatric evidence remains preliminary.",
