  "description": "Chromium is a dietary trace mineral that enhances the action of insulin and is essential for carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. The most commonly studied supplemental form is chromium picolinate. Clinical studies suggest that chromium may benefit individuals with atypical depression, particularly those with carbohydrate craving and weight gain, as well as in improving glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes and PCOS. However, evidence is mixed, and benefits appear modest. Chromium is generally safe at low doses, but high doses may cause kidney or liver toxicity.",
