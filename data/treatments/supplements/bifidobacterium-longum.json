  "summary": "A probiotic bacterium studied for digestive health, immune balance, and emerging benefits in stress, mood, and cognitive function via the gut–brain axis.",
  "description": "Bifidobacterium longum is one of the earliest colonizers of the human gut microbiome and plays a key role in intestinal health. It ferments carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), supports barrier integrity, and reduces inflammation. Certain strains, such as B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum 1714, have been investigated for gastrointestinal conditions, immune regulation, metabolic health, and psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline.",
