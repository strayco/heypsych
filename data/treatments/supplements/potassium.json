  "summary": "Potassium is an essential mineral and electrolyte critical for nerve transmission, muscle contraction, cardiovascular health, and fluid balance. Supplementation is mainly used to treat deficiency states.",
  "description": "Potassium is the primary intracellular cation, playing a vital role in maintaining fluid balance, acid-base homeostasis, neuromuscular function, and cardiac rhythm. It is widely obtained from dietary sources such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. Deficiency (hypokalemia) can result from diuretic use, gastrointestinal losses, or chronic medical conditions, and may cause fatigue, weakness, cramps, and arrhythmias. While supplementation can correct deficiency, it must be used cautiously since excessive potassium (hyperkalemia) can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Over-the-counter potassium supplements are generally limited in dose due to safety concerns, with prescription formulations used for clinical management of hypokalemia.",
