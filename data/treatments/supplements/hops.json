  "description": "Hops are the flowers of Humulus lupulus, traditionally used in beer brewing and herbal medicine. Rich in bitter acids, essential oils, and flavonoids such as xanthohumol, hops have been studied for their sedative and hypnotic properties. Extracts are commonly used in natural sleep remedies, often in combination with valerian root or passionflower, to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality. Research suggests that hops modulate GABAergic activity, contributing to calming effects.",
