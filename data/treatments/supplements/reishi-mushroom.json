  "summary": "Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) is a medicinal mushroom traditionally used for immune support, stress reduction, and longevity, with emerging evidence for neuroprotective and mental health benefits.",
  "description": "Reishi mushroom, known as Ganoderma lucidum or 'Lingzhi,' has been used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine for over 2,000 years. It contains bioactive compounds such as polysaccharides, triterpenes, and peptidoglycans, which are believed to modulate the immune system, reduce inflammation, and support stress resilience. Reishi is commonly used to promote relaxation, improve sleep quality, and support cardiovascular and metabolic health. In mental health contexts, it may influence fatigue, stress, and mood regulation, though evidence remains limited and primarily from preclinical and small clinical studies.",
