  "summary": "A traditional herbal remedy used for mild anxiety, insomnia, and nervous restlessness, thought to have sedative and anxiolytic effects without strong dependence potential.",
  "description": "California poppy is a flowering plant native to the western United States. Unlike the opium poppy, it does not contain morphine or codeine, but instead harbors alkaloids such as californidine and eschscholtzine, which exhibit mild sedative and anxiolytic properties. Traditionally used by Native American communities for pain, restlessness, and sleep disturbances, California poppy is available today as a supplement in capsules, teas, and tinctures. It is often combined with other calming herbs such as valerian or passionflower. While its effects are generally mild, it may provide benefit for individuals with mild insomnia, stress, or anxiety without the risks associated with benzodiazepines or opioids.",
