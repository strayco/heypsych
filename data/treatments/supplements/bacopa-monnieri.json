  "description": "Bacopa monnieri, also known as Brahmi, is a creeping marsh plant long used in Ayurveda as a medhya rasayana (nootropic). Active constituents—bacosides (A, B), bacopasaponins—appear to enhance synaptic communication, support cholinergic transmission, and provide antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. Modern trials suggest benefits for memory acquisition and retention, processing speed, and anxiety/stress measures, with greatest effects after 4–12 weeks of continuous use. The most common adverse effect is dose-related gastrointestinal upset.",
