  "description": "L-theanine is a naturally occurring amino acid found in tea (Camellia sinensis) and certain mushrooms. It is best known for promoting relaxation without drowsiness, supporting stress reduction, and enhancing attention and cognitive performance, especially when combined with caffeine. Mechanistically, L-theanine influences neurotransmitter activity, including GABA, serotonin, and dopamine, and may modulate alpha brain waves, contributing to its calming yet alertness-promoting effects. It is generally safe, well tolerated, and commonly used as a nootropic and anxiolytic supplement.",
