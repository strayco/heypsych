  "description": "Ginseng, particularly Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) and Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng), is one of the most studied adaptogenic herbs in traditional and modern medicine. It contains active compounds called ginsenosides, which are thought to influence neurotransmission, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Ginseng has been promoted for improving mental performance, reducing fatigue, supporting immune health, and alleviating symptoms of stress and depression. While some clinical trials support these effects, results are mixed, and efficacy varies depending on the species, extract standardization, and duration of treatment.",
