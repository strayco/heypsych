  "summary": "Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is an essential water-soluble vitamin required for red blood cell formation, neurological function, and DNA synthesis. Deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia and irreversible neurological damage.",
  "description": "Vitamin B12 is unique among vitamins as it contains cobalt and is found naturally only in animal-derived foods. It is essential for methylation reactions, homocysteine metabolism, and myelin synthesis. Deficiency is common in strict vegans, older adults with malabsorption, and patients with pernicious anemia. Treatment often requires high-dose oral supplementation or intramuscular injections. Active forms include methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, while cyanocobalamin is a common supplemental form.",
