  "description": "Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound derived from turmeric, a spice long used in traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. It exerts broad biological effects including inhibition of inflammatory pathways, modulation of neurotransmitters, enhancement of neurogenesis, and protection against oxidative stress. Curcumin is being studied for its role in mood disorders, cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative diseases, though its clinical impact is limited by poor bioavailability unless formulated with absorption enhancers (e.g., piperine).",
