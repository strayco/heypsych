  "description": "American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) is a perennial plant native to North America. It contains ginsenosides, active compounds thought to influence energy metabolism, stress response, and cognition. Unlike Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng), American ginseng is considered to have a more calming effect. It has been used in traditional medicine for enhancing vitality, improving memory, reducing fatigue, and modulating blood sugar. Clinical studies suggest modest benefits for mental performance, fatigue in cancer patients, and glycemic control in diabetes.",
