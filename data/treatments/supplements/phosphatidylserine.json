  "summary": "Phosphatidylserine is a phospholipid that supports cognitive function, memory, stress resilience, and neuronal cell membrane integrity.",
  "description": "Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a naturally occurring phospholipid concentrated in brain cell membranes, where it plays a crucial role in cell signaling, neurotransmitter release, and membrane fluidity. Supplementation has been studied for supporting memory, cognitive performance, and stress response, particularly in older adults and individuals with cognitive decline. Some studies suggest it may improve mood and reduce cortisol levels under stress. While PS was originally derived from bovine brain, modern supplements are typically sourced from soy or sunflower lecithin. It remains a popular nootropic and integrative medicine supplement, though evidence varies by indication.",
