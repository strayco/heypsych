  "description": "Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid found in protein-rich foods and synthesized in the body from phenylalanine. It serves as a precursor for catecholamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and thyroid hormones. Supplementation has been investigated for enhancing cognitive performance under stress, fatigue, and sleep deprivation, as well as for supporting mood and motivation. While it may help preserve mental performance in stressful situations, evidence for benefits in depression or ADHD is mixed.",
