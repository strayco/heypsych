  "summary": "A naturally occurring amino acid and chemical precursor to serotonin, often used as a dietary supplement to support mood, sleep, and appetite regulation.",
  "description": "5-HTP is derived from the seeds of the African plant Griffonia simplicifolia. It serves as a direct precursor to serotonin and indirectly to melatonin. As a supplement, it is marketed for improving mood, alleviating depression, supporting sleep, reducing anxiety, and assisting with weight management. Evidence is mixed, with some small studies showing benefits in depression, insomnia, and fibromyalgia, while larger high-quality trials are limited.",
