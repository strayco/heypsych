  "summary": "A naturally occurring compound stored in muscle and brain tissue that supports cellular energy production. Supplementation is widely used for athletic performance and is being investigated for neuropsychiatric and cognitive benefits.",
  "description": "Creatine is a nitrogenous organic acid synthesized from amino acids and stored primarily in skeletal muscle and the brain as phosphocreatine. It plays a critical role in the ATP-phosphocreatine energy system, rapidly regenerating ATP during high-demand states. Supplementation is well established in sports and exercise performance, but emerging evidence supports its potential for neuroprotection, antidepressant augmentation, cognitive enhancement, and neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and traumatic brain injury.",
