  "summary": "Digestive enzyme supplements contain naturally occurring proteins such as amylase, protease, and lipase that help break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and are sometimes used to improve gastrointestinal comfort and nutrient absorption.",
  "description": "Digestive enzymes are substances produced in the pancreas, stomach, and small intestine, as well as derived from plants (e.g., papain, bromelain) and microbial sources. Supplementation is intended to support digestion in individuals with enzyme insufficiency or functional gastrointestinal issues. While primarily used for digestive health, improved nutrient absorption and reduced gut inflammation may have downstream effects on mental health, given the gut-brain axis.",
