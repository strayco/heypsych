  "summary": "Vitamin B2, or riboflavin, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a critical role in energy metabolism, antioxidant defense, and cellular function.",
  "description": "Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) is an essential B-complex vitamin required for the production of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), coenzymes that participate in numerous redox reactions involved in energy production, metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins, and antioxidant protection. It also supports healthy skin, eyes, and neurological function. Deficiency can cause ariboflavinosis, presenting with sore throat, angular cheilitis, glossitis, and anemia. Supplementation is sometimes used in the prevention of migraines and to support overall metabolic health.",
