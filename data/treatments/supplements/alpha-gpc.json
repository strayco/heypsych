  "description": "Alpha-GPC is a naturally occurring choline compound found in small amounts in the brain and various foods. As a supplement, it serves as a highly bioavailable source of choline, supporting acetylcholine synthesis, a key neurotransmitter involved in memory and learning. It has been investigated in Europe as a prescription drug for Alzheimer’s disease and stroke recovery, and is commonly marketed as a nootropic. Some evidence suggests it may improve memory, attention, and learning, though results are mixed. It may also support physical performance by enhancing growth hormone release.",
