  "summary": "St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a widely used herbal supplement for mild-to-moderate depression, with additional applications for anxiety and sleep disturbances.",
  "description": "St. John’s Wort is a flowering plant native to Europe and used for centuries in traditional medicine. Its active compounds, including hypericin and hyperforin, are thought to modulate neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. It has been shown in multiple clinical trials to be effective for mild-to-moderate depression, sometimes comparable to standard antidepressants. However, its extensive interactions with prescription medications—especially through induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein—make it a high-risk supplement in polypharmacy settings. It is generally well tolerated but requires careful monitoring when combined with other drugs.",
