  "summary": "Jujube is a traditional medicinal fruit used for relaxation, sleep enhancement, digestive support, and immune modulation. It has adaptogenic and anxiolytic properties with a long history in traditional Chinese and Korean medicine.",
  "description": "Jujube, also known as Chinese date (Ziziphus jujuba), is a fruit-bearing plant used in traditional medicine for over 2,500 years. It is rich in flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides that are believed to contribute to its calming, antioxidant, and immune-supporting effects. Traditionally, jujube is used to relieve stress, improve sleep quality, support digestion, and enhance energy. Modern research is investigating its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory potential, although most clinical evidence is preliminary.",
