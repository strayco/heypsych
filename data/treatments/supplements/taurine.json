  "summary": "Taurine is a naturally occurring amino sulfonic acid with roles in neurological function, cardiovascular health, electrolyte regulation, and antioxidant defense.",
  "description": "Taurine is not incorporated into proteins but is abundant in excitable tissues such as the brain, retina, heart, and skeletal muscle. It supports osmoregulation, calcium signaling, bile salt formation, and neurotransmission. As a supplement, taurine is explored for cardiovascular support, anxiety modulation, neuroprotection, and exercise performance. It is generally well tolerated and also widely consumed in energy drinks, though doses in supplements are usually more controlled.",
