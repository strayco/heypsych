  "summary": "Magnolia bark, derived from Magnolia officinalis, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for anxiety, stress, and sleep. Its active compounds, honokiol and magnolol, exert GABAergic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects.",
  "description": "Magnolia bark extract has a long history of use in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine as an anxiolytic, sedative, and digestive aid. Modern research highlights honokiol and magnolol, its primary bioactive compounds, for their potential to modulate GABA-A receptors, reduce cortisol, and support neuroprotection. It is being studied for anxiety, depression, insomnia, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic conditions, though robust human clinical trials remain limited.",
