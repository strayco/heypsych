  "summary": "An amino acid–like compound involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, studied as a supplement for cognitive health, depression, and fatigue.",
  "description": "Carnitine is a naturally occurring compound derived from lysine and methionine. It plays a central role in transporting fatty acids into mitochondria for energy production. Supplementation is often used in two primary forms: L-carnitine, which supports muscular and metabolic health, and Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR), which can cross the blood-brain barrier and may support cognitive function. Clinical research suggests potential benefits in depression, age-related cognitive decline, neuropathic pain, and fatigue syndromes. Carnitine supplementation is generally well tolerated, though some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal upset or a 'fishy' odor due to metabolite excretion.",
