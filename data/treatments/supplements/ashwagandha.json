  "description": "Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), also known as Indian ginseng or winter cherry, is a well-known adaptogen in Ayurvedic medicine. Its active compounds, called withanolides, are thought to modulate stress responses, reduce cortisol, and improve sleep quality. Modern research supports its use for anxiety, stress, mild depression, sleep disturbances, and physical performance. It has also been studied for potential cognitive benefits and hormonal balance, particularly in men with low testosterone.",
