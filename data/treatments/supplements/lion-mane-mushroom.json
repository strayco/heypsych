  "summary": "Lion’s mane mushroom (*Hericium erinaceus*) is a medicinal mushroom studied for its potential neuroprotective, cognitive-enhancing, and mood-supporting effects.",
  "description": "Lion’s mane mushroom is a culinary and medicinal mushroom traditionally used in East Asian medicine. Modern research has focused on its neurotrophic effects, particularly its ability to stimulate nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, which supports neuroplasticity and repair. Preclinical and early clinical studies suggest potential benefits for cognitive decline, anxiety, depression, and neuropathy. Active compounds include hericenones and erinacines, which may cross the blood-brain barrier and promote neurogenesis. While promising, large-scale clinical trials are still lacking, and lion’s mane is considered investigational for mental health indications.",
