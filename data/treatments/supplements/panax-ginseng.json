  "summary": "Panax ginseng is an adaptogenic herb traditionally used in East Asian medicine to improve energy, resilience to stress, cognitive performance, and overall well-being.",
  "description": "Panax ginseng, also called Asian or Korean ginseng, contains active compounds known as ginsenosides that exert effects on the nervous system, endocrine system, and immune regulation. It has been used for centuries as a tonic to enhance vitality, reduce fatigue, and promote mental clarity. Modern research suggests potential benefits in stress adaptation, cognitive function, fatigue reduction, and mood regulation. Evidence is mixed, with some randomized trials showing improvements in energy and attention, while psychiatric benefits remain exploratory.",
