  "summary": "Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for blood clotting, bone metabolism, and vascular health. It exists primarily in two forms: K1 (phylloquinone) from plants and K2 (menaquinones) produced by bacteria or found in animal-based foods.",
  "description": "Vitamin K is crucial for the activation of clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and proteins involved in bone and vascular health. Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) is found mainly in leafy green vegetables, while vitamin K2 (menaquinones, MK-4 to MK-13) comes from fermented foods, meats, and gut bacteria. Supplementation is used to treat deficiency, prevent bleeding disorders, and support bone health. Vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) interfere with its action, requiring careful monitoring of intake. Emerging evidence suggests a role in reducing vascular calcification and supporting cardiovascular health, particularly for K2.",
