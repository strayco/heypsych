  "description": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, critical for regulating neuronal excitability and maintaining balance with excitatory glutamate. Oral GABA supplements are widely marketed for relaxation, stress reduction, improved sleep, and mood support. However, the ability of orally ingested GABA to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) remains controversial, and much of its clinical effect may be mediated via the enteric nervous system or indirect mechanisms such as gut–brain signaling. Despite limited robust evidence, GABA supplements remain popular in integrative and alternative medicine settings.",
