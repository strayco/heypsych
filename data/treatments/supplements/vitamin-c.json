  "summary": "Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is an essential water-soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties, important for collagen synthesis, immune function, iron absorption, and wound healing. Severe deficiency causes scurvy.",
  "description": "Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant and enzymatic cofactor involved in hydroxylation reactions. It is critical for collagen production, neurotransmitter synthesis, and immune defense. Humans cannot synthesize vitamin C, requiring dietary intake from fruits and vegetables. Deficiency results in scurvy, with symptoms including bleeding gums, poor wound healing, fatigue, and anemia. Beyond deficiency prevention, vitamin C is widely studied for its role in immunity, skin health, cardiovascular protection, and as an adjunctive therapy in infections and cancer.",
