  "summary": "Fish oil is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, primarily EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), widely studied for cardiovascular, cognitive, and mood-related benefits.",
  "description": "Fish oil is derived from the tissues of oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines. It contains the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are integral to cell membrane function, anti-inflammatory pathways, and brain health. Fish oil is one of the most extensively researched dietary supplements, with evidence supporting its role in cardiovascular disease prevention, lowering triglycerides, and adjunctive therapy in mood disorders like depression. It is also commonly used for cognitive support, inflammatory conditions, and general wellness.",
