  "summary": "Iron is an essential mineral required for hemoglobin production, oxygen transport, and numerous enzymatic processes. Supplementation is commonly used to treat or prevent iron-deficiency anemia.",
  "description": "Iron is a trace mineral vital for red blood cell formation, energy metabolism, and neurological function. It is found naturally in foods (heme iron from animal sources, non-heme iron from plant sources) and available as a dietary supplement. Iron deficiency can lead to anemia, fatigue, impaired cognitive function, and mood disturbances. Supplementation restores iron stores, supports cognitive performance, and improves energy levels. However, excess iron can be toxic and should be avoided unless deficiency is documented.",
