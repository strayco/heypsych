  "summary": "Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) is an herbal supplement traditionally used for liver health. Its active compound, silymarin, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective effects, and has been investigated for metabolic, psychiatric, and neurological benefits.",
  "description": "Milk thistle is a flowering plant whose seeds contain silymarin, a mixture of flavonolignans with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a long history of use as a liver tonic and is commonly taken to support liver function in cases of alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis, and toxin-induced liver injury. Emerging evidence suggests possible benefits for metabolic regulation, cognition, and psychiatric health, though research is less conclusive outside of hepatology. It is widely available as an over-the-counter herbal supplement.",
