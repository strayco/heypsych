  "summary": "A plant-based oil rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and omega-6 fatty acids, studied for its potential benefits in inflammation, skin health, hormonal balance, and mood regulation.",
  "description": "Black currant oil is extracted from the seeds of the Ribes nigrum plant. It is a rich source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and other polyunsaturated fatty acids that have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Traditionally used for skin conditions, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and joint health, it has also been investigated for potential mood-stabilizing and neuroprotective effects. Some evidence suggests a role in supporting cardiovascular health and reducing oxidative stress.",
