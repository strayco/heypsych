  "summary": "Rhodiola (Rhodiola rosea) is an adaptogenic herb traditionally used to reduce fatigue, enhance resilience to stress, and support mood and cognitive performance.",
  "description": "Rhodiola rosea is an adaptogenic plant native to cold regions of Europe and Asia. Its active compounds, such as rosavins and salidroside, are thought to modulate stress-response pathways, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, monoamine neurotransmitters, and mitochondrial function. It has been studied for its ability to reduce symptoms of fatigue, improve cognitive performance under stress, and support mood and anxiety disorders. While evidence suggests potential benefit in mild to moderate depression and stress-related fatigue, clinical data remain modest and heterogeneous.",
