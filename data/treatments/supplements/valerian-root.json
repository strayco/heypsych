  "summary": "Valerian root (Valeriana officinalis) is a traditional herbal remedy commonly used for insomnia, anxiety, and stress-related sleep disturbances.",
  "description": "Valerian root is derived from the plant *Valeriana officinalis* and has been used for centuries as a natural sedative and anxiolytic. It is thought to enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling in the brain, promoting relaxation and sleep. Research on its efficacy is mixed, but some studies support its use for reducing sleep latency and improving subjective sleep quality. It is generally considered safe for short-term use, though long-term safety is less established.",
