  "description": "Thiamine (Vitamin B1) is a vital coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism, helping convert glucose into energy. It is essential for the functioning of the nervous system, muscles, and heart. Deficiency can lead to serious neurological and cardiovascular disorders, including beriberi and Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, particularly in individuals with chronic alcohol use. Supplementation supports energy production, nerve health, and may be used in psychiatry for alcohol-related conditions and stress-related fatigue.",
