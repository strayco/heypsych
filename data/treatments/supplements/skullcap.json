  "summary": "Skullcap (Scutellaria species) is a traditional herbal remedy used for its calming, anxiolytic, and sleep-promoting properties.",
  "description": "Skullcap refers to a group of herbs in the Scutellaria genus, most commonly American skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora) and Chinese skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis). American skullcap is traditionally used in Western herbalism as a nervine and mild anxiolytic, helping relieve nervous tension, insomnia, and restlessness. Chinese skullcap, in contrast, has been widely studied for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective compounds such as baicalin and baicalein. While commonly used as a calming herb in integrative psychiatry, high-quality clinical evidence is limited. It is considered generally safe but must be distinguished from adulterated or mislabeled products, which have historically been linked to hepatotoxicity.",
