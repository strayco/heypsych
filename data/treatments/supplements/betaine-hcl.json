  "description": "Betaine hydrochloride (Betaine HCl) is a supplemental form of betaine combined with hydrochloric acid. It has historically been used to treat low stomach acid (hypochlorhydria), support protein digestion, and improve absorption of key nutrients such as vitamin B12, iron, calcium, and magnesium. Research evidence is limited, and it is no longer approved as a prescription digestive aid in the U.S. It is available as an over-the-counter supplement, often combined with pepsin. Safety concerns include risk of gastritis, esophageal irritation, and exacerbation of peptic ulcers.",
