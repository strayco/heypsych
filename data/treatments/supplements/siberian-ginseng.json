  "description": "Siberian ginseng, also known as Eleuthero, is a woody shrub native to Northeast Asia and long used in traditional Chinese and Russian medicine as an adaptogen. Unlike true Panax ginseng, Siberian ginseng contains eleutherosides rather than ginsenosides. These compounds are thought to modulate the stress response, enhance physical stamina, and support immune activity. It has been studied for its potential to improve mental performance under stress, reduce fatigue, and support recovery from illness. Evidence in psychiatric and integrative medicine suggests possible benefits for resilience, cognitive performance, and mood stabilization, though high-quality data are limited.",
