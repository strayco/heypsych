  "summary": "Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is a water-soluble vitamin essential for amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, hemoglobin production, and regulation of homocysteine levels.",
  "description": "Vitamin B6 refers to a group of related compounds including pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, which are converted in the body to the active form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). PLP functions as a coenzyme in over 100 enzymatic reactions, especially those involved in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter production (such as serotonin, dopamine, GABA), hemoglobin synthesis, and gluconeogenesis. Deficiency may lead to anemia, irritability, depression, confusion, weakened immune function, and in severe cases, seizures. It is sometimes supplemented for premenstrual syndrome (PMS), morning sickness, and mood regulation, though evidence varies.",
