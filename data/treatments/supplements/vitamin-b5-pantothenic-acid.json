  "summary": "Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is an essential water-soluble vitamin that plays a critical role in energy metabolism and synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA).",
  "description": "Pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5) is a member of the B-complex vitamins, necessary for the synthesis of coenzyme A, a central cofactor in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It is also involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, steroid hormones, acetylcholine, and hemoglobin. Deficiency is rare due to its widespread presence in foods, but when it occurs, it may lead to fatigue, irritability, numbness, muscle cramps, and the so-called 'burning feet syndrome.' Vitamin B5 is sometimes supplemented for stress reduction, skin health, and wound healing, though clinical evidence is limited.",
