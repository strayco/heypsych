  "summary": "A humanistic form of psychotherapy that helps individuals confront existential concerns such as meaning, freedom, isolation, and mortality to live more authentically.",
  "description": "Existential Therapy is a philosophical and humanistic approach to psychotherapy that emphasizes personal responsibility, freedom of choice, and the search for meaning. Rooted in the works of existential philosophers like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Sartre, this therapy focuses on universal human concerns—death, freedom, isolation, and meaninglessness. Rather than aiming to eliminate symptoms, existential therapy helps clients develop deeper self-awareness, embrace authentic living, and make meaningful choices. It is highly individualized and can be integrated with other therapeutic modalities.",
