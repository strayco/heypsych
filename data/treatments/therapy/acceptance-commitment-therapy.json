  "description": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a form of psychotherapy rooted in behavioral and mindfulness traditions. It helps individuals develop psychological flexibility by teaching them to accept unpleasant thoughts and feelings, defuse from unhelpful cognitions, clarify personal values, and commit to behavior aligned with those values. Rather than eliminating symptoms, ACT focuses on fostering resilience, reducing avoidance, and building a meaningful life.",
