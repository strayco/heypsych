  "summary": "Transference-Focused Therapy (TFT) is a structured psychodynamic therapy designed to treat borderline personality disorder (BPD) and other personality disorders by focusing on the patient’s relationship with the therapist as a way to understand and integrate fragmented self- and object-representations.",
  "description": "Transference-Focused Therapy (TFT), also known as Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP), is a manualized, evidence-based form of psychodynamic psychotherapy developed by Otto Kernberg and colleagues. It is specifically designed to treat borderline personality disorder and other severe personality disorders. TFT works by exploring and interpreting the transference — the patient's projections and relational patterns as they emerge in the therapeutic relationship — to help patients integrate split and contradictory internal representations of self and others. Through consistent interpretation, patients gradually develop more coherent self-concepts, improved emotional regulation, and healthier interpersonal functioning.",
