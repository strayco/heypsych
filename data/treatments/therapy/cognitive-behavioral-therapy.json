  "summary": "A widely used, evidence-based psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and modifying maladaptive thoughts, behaviors, and emotional responses.",
  "description": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a structured, goal-oriented psychotherapy that emphasizes the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Developed by Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis, CBT helps individuals recognize and challenge distorted cognitions and replace them with healthier, more adaptive patterns of thinking and acting. It is typically short-term (12–20 sessions), skills-based, and has been adapted into many specialized forms (e.g., CBT-I for insomnia, TF-CBT for trauma, and exposure-based CBT for anxiety disorders). CBT is one of the most empirically validated psychotherapies and is effective across a broad spectrum of mental health conditions.",
