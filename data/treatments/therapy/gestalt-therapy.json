  "summary": "A humanistic psychotherapy emphasizing awareness, present-moment experience, and personal responsibility to foster growth and resolve unfinished issues.",
  "description": "Gestalt Therapy is a humanistic, experiential approach to psychotherapy developed by Fritz Perls and colleagues in the mid-20th century. It emphasizes awareness, personal responsibility, and the importance of the present moment. Instead of focusing solely on past experiences, Gestalt Therapy encourages clients to explore their thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and bodily sensations in the here-and-now. Core techniques include the 'empty chair' dialogue, guided awareness, role play, and exploration of unfinished business. Gestalt Therapy aims to help individuals integrate fragmented aspects of the self, enhance awareness, and develop authentic, meaningful ways of living.",
