  "summary": "A specialized form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that involves systematic exposure to anxiety-provoking thoughts or situations while preventing the compulsive responses that usually follow.",
  "description": "Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is a frontline, evidence-based treatment primarily for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It involves gradually and systematically exposing individuals to feared thoughts, images, or situations that trigger anxiety, while guiding them to refrain from performing compulsive behaviors or rituals. Over time, this reduces the distress associated with obsessive triggers and helps break the cycle of obsessions and compulsions. ERP can be delivered in individual therapy, group therapy, or intensive outpatient programs, and is considered one of the most effective interventions for OCD.",
