  "description": "Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) is a short-term, evidence-based family intervention developed for children and adolescents with behavioral problems, emotional difficulties, or substance use issues. It integrates structural and strategic family therapy approaches, focusing on identifying and altering maladaptive family interaction patterns (e.g., alliances, boundaries, escalation cycles) that contribute to the maintenance of youth problems. Therapists actively join with each family member, reframe problems to reduce blame, and coach families in-session to implement new, more adaptive interactional sequences. BSFT has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing externalizing disorders, adolescent substance use, and family conflict, and is widely implemented in community, outpatient, and justice-involved settings.",

Therapists actively join with the family, identify problematic sequences (e.g., weak parental boundaries, high conflict, alliances), and use reframing and restructuring techniques to create healthier boundaries, enhance parental leadership, and strengthen family cohesion.
