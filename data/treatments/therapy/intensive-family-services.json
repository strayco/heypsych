  "description": "Intensive Family Services (IFS) are comprehensive, home- or community-based interventions designed to stabilize families in crisis, prevent unnecessary foster care or residential placement, and strengthen family functioning. These services typically involve frequent contact with families, case management, counseling, parenting support, and coordination with schools and community agencies. IFS models draw from evidence-based family therapy approaches, crisis intervention, and parent training to address safety, behavioral, and relational concerns.",
