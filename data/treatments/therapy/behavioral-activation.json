  "summary": "A structured, evidence-based therapy that reduces depression by increasing engagement in rewarding, values-aligned activities and decreasing avoidance patterns.",
  "description": "Behavioral Activation (BA) is a straightforward cognitive-behavioral intervention that targets the avoidance and withdrawal patterns central to depression. By systematically scheduling and reinforcing meaningful activities, BA increases contact with positive reinforcement and rebuilds routines that support mood and functioning. The approach is highly pragmatic, skills-focused, and adaptable across settings and populations, with strong evidence showing outcomes comparable to full CBT for depression.",
