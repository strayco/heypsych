  "description": "Support groups are structured gatherings where people experiencing similar mental health, medical, or life challenges meet to provide mutual support. These groups can be professionally led by a therapist or peer-led by individuals with lived experience. Through open sharing, active listening, and mutual encouragement, participants develop a sense of belonging, reduce isolation, and gain coping skills. Support groups are used for a wide range of conditions, including depression, anxiety, addiction recovery, grief, trauma, and chronic illness. They may be in-person or virtual and vary in structure, size, and focus.",
