  "summary": "Somatic Experiencing is a body-focused therapy designed to resolve trauma and chronic stress by helping individuals release stored physiological tension and restore natural self-regulation.",
  "description": "Somatic Experiencing (SE), developed by Dr. Peter Levine, is a trauma therapy that emphasizes the body’s innate capacity to heal. It views trauma not as the event itself, but as the dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system that results from overwhelming experiences. SE uses gentle awareness of bodily sensations, movement, and the release of physical tension (discharge) to restore balance. By working with sensations rather than explicit re-exposure to trauma, SE helps clients renegotiate traumatic experiences and reestablish a sense of safety and resilience.",
