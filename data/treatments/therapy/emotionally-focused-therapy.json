  "summary": "A structured, short-term form of couples and family therapy that focuses on identifying, understanding, and transforming negative interaction patterns while strengthening emotional bonds.",
  "description": "Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) is an evidence-based therapeutic approach developed by Dr. Sue Johnson in the 1980s. It is grounded in attachment theory and aims to help couples and families create secure emotional bonds by identifying and restructuring interactional patterns that create distress. EFT focuses on helping individuals express underlying attachment needs and emotions in a safe and supportive environment. By fostering secure emotional connections, EFT reduces conflict, enhances communication, and improves relationship satisfaction. EFT has three stages: de-escalation of negative cycles, restructuring interactions through emotional engagement, and consolidation of new, healthier patterns.",
