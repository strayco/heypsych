  "description": "Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) is a strengths-based, future-focused therapeutic approach that helps clients identify resources, past successes, and achievable goals to create positive change. Rather than analyzing problems or their origins, SFBT emphasizes clients’ existing strengths, resilience, and capacities. The therapy is collaborative, brief, and structured, using techniques like the miracle question, scaling, and exception-finding to help clients set realistic goals and implement practical solutions.",
