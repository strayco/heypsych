  "description": "Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapy approach developed by Francine Shapiro in the late 1980s. It is primarily used for treating trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The therapy involves recalling distressing experiences while simultaneously focusing on bilateral sensory input, such as side-to-side eye movements, taps, or auditory tones. EMDR is structured into eight phases, including history taking, preparation, assessment, desensitization, installation, body scan, closure, and reevaluation. Research shows EMDR can reduce the emotional intensity and vividness of traumatic memories and foster adaptive reprocessing.",
