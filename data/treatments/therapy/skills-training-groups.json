  "summary": "Skills Training Groups are structured, group-based interventions that teach practical coping, emotional regulation, and interpersonal skills to support mental health and daily functioning.",
  "description": "Skills Training Groups are therapeutic group interventions designed to teach participants specific skills for managing emotions, improving interpersonal effectiveness, enhancing coping strategies, and reducing maladaptive behaviors. These groups are often used as part of broader evidence-based therapies, such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), but can also be stand-alone interventions. Skills training groups emphasize psychoeducation, modeling, role-playing, and practice exercises to help participants internalize and apply learned skills in daily life.",
