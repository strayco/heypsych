  "summary": "A structured couples therapy approach that improves relationship satisfaction by enhancing communication, conflict resolution, and intimacy.",
  "description": "The Gottman Method is a research-based form of couples therapy developed by Drs. John and Julie Gottman. It is grounded in decades of observational research on relationship dynamics. The approach helps couples strengthen friendship, improve conflict management, and create shared meaning. Therapy sessions focus on building intimacy, addressing destructive communication patterns, and fostering mutual respect and empathy. Structured interventions and practical tools are used to replace negative interactions with positive ones, reduce conflict, and increase emotional connection.",
