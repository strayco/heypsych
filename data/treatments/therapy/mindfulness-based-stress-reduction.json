It integrates mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and gentle yoga to help individuals cope with stress, chronic pain, anxiety, and illness. MBSR emphasizes cultivating present-moment awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance of experiences, reducing the impact of stress and improving overall well-being. It is widely used in medical, psychological, and community settings, with extensive research supporting its effectiveness.",
