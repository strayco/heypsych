  "summary": "A relationship-centered, developmental guidance model that equips caregivers and providers to anticipate child development spurts and regressions, strengthening the parent–child relationship from birth through early childhood.",
  "description": "Brazelton Touchpoints® is an evidence-informed, strengths-based approach to early relational health and child development. The model helps caregivers and professionals anticipate predictable periods of disorganization that precede developmental leaps (“touchpoints”), reframing regressions as signs of growth rather than problems. Through collaborative, culturally responsive guidance, providers partner with families to read infant and toddler cues, support co-regulation, and scaffold routines that enhance attachment, development, and caregiver confidence across medical, home-visiting, and early education settings.",
