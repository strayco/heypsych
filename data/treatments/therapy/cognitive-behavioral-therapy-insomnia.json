  "summary": "A specialized form of CBT designed to treat chronic insomnia by addressing maladaptive sleep habits, dysfunctional beliefs, and behavioral patterns that interfere with restful sleep.",
  "description": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line, evidence-based treatment for chronic insomnia. Unlike general CBT, CBT-I is tailored specifically to sleep difficulties and includes strategies such as stimulus control, sleep restriction therapy, relaxation training, and cognitive restructuring. CBT-I has been shown to be as effective as, or more effective than, pharmacological sleep aids in the long term, with sustained benefits after treatment completion. It is effective across populations, including older adults, individuals with comorbid depression or anxiety, and those with chronic medical conditions.",

Cognitive techniques target dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (e.g., catastrophizing the effects of poor sleep), while behavioral strategies—such as stimulus control and sleep restriction—realign sleep-wake patterns and strengthen the bed as a cue for sleep. Relaxation and mindfulness-based approaches reduce physiological arousal that interferes with sleep onset and maintenance."
