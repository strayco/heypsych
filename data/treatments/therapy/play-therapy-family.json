  "summary": "Family Play Therapy is a therapeutic approach that uses play-based activities to improve family communication, strengthen relationships, and resolve conflicts by engaging both children and caregivers in structured, guided play sessions.",
  "description": "Family Play Therapy integrates principles of play therapy with family systems approaches. It provides a safe and engaging environment where children and their caregivers can express feelings, explore dynamics, and practice healthier patterns of interaction through play. By observing and participating in play, therapists can identify relational patterns, emotional needs, and communication barriers within the family. This approach is especially effective for children who may not have the verbal capacity to articulate their experiences but can express themselves through play. Family Play Therapy is flexible, incorporating art, role-play, sandtray, storytelling, and games to foster family connection, empathy, and problem-solving skills.",
