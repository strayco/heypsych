  "summary": "An existential psychotherapy developed by Viktor Frankl that emphasizes finding meaning in life as the primary motivation for human beings.",
  "description": "Logotherapy, created by psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, is a form of existential analysis that centers on the belief that the search for meaning is the core driving force in human life. Unlike therapies that focus primarily on symptom reduction, Logotherapy helps individuals confront existential concerns such as freedom, responsibility, suffering, and mortality. It aims to help patients identify meaning in their experiences and pursue purposeful living, which in turn reduces psychological distress.",
