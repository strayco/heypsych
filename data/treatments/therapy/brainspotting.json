  "summary": "A focused therapy technique that identifies and processes traumatic memories by guiding attention to 'brainspots' — eye positions that correlate with unresolved emotional experiences.",
  "description": "Brainspotting (BSP), developed by Dr. David Grand in 2003, is a therapeutic approach that uses eye positions, or 'brainspots,' to access unprocessed trauma and emotional distress stored in the subcortical brain. The therapist helps the client identify relevant eye positions while simultaneously holding awareness of body sensations and emotions. By maintaining attention on these internal experiences, clients are able to process and release trauma more deeply than through talk therapy alone. BSP is rooted in somatic and neurobiological principles, overlapping with EMDR and mindfulness, and is used to treat PTSD, anxiety, depression, performance blocks, and other conditions.",
