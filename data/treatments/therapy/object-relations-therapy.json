  "summary": "Object Relations Therapy is a psychodynamic approach that explores how early relationships with caregivers shape current emotional experiences and interpersonal patterns.",
  "description": "Object Relations Therapy is a form of psychodynamic psychotherapy grounded in object relations theory, which emphasizes the internalized mental representations ('objects') of significant caregivers formed during early childhood. These internalized relationships influence how individuals perceive themselves, others, and the world. Therapy focuses on uncovering, interpreting, and restructuring these internalized object relations to promote healthier self-concepts and interpersonal functioning. The therapist helps the client become aware of unconscious patterns, work through unresolved conflicts, and improve the ability to form secure, adaptive relationships.",
