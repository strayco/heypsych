  "summary": "A developmental, relationship-based intervention for children, particularly those with autism spectrum disorder, that emphasizes emotional connection, play, and individualized growth.",
  "description": "DIR/Floortime (Developmental, Individual-differences, Relationship-based model) is an intervention designed to support children with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental challenges. Created by Dr. Stanley Greenspan and Dr. Serena Wieder, the approach emphasizes building emotional and social skills through interactive, child-led play. The therapist or caregiver follows the child's interests, using playful engagement to encourage communication, problem-solving, and self-regulation. Unlike structured behavioral methods, DIR/Floortime prioritizes emotional development and the parent-child relationship as the foundation for learning.",
