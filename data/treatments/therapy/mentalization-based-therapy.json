  "summary": "An evidence-based psychodynamic therapy designed to improve mentalization—the ability to understand one’s own and others’ thoughts and feelings—commonly used for borderline personality disorder and related difficulties.",
  "description": "Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT) is a structured, evidence-based psychotherapy originally developed by Peter Fonagy and Anthony Bateman for individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). The core principle is that many emotional and relational problems stem from difficulties in 'mentalizing,' or accurately understanding and reflecting on one’s own mental states and those of others. MBT uses a supportive, relational, and curiosity-driven approach to strengthen mentalizing capacities, reduce impulsivity, and improve affect regulation. It is typically offered in both individual and group therapy formats, often in long-term treatment plans.",
