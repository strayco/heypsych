  "summary": "Parent-Infant Psychotherapy (PIP) is a relational and psychodynamic intervention designed to support parents and their infants by addressing attachment difficulties, unresolved trauma, and early relational stressors.",
  "description": "Parent-Infant Psychotherapy (PIP) is a therapeutic approach aimed at enhancing the parent-infant relationship during the critical early years of development. It is often provided to families experiencing bonding difficulties, maternal or paternal mental health concerns, or when the infant shows signs of distress or developmental challenges. PIP typically involves both parent(s) and infant in the therapy sessions, where the therapist helps parents reflect on their own experiences, understand the infant’s emotional needs, and strengthen attachment security. It draws from psychodynamic, attachment, and developmental psychology frameworks and can prevent the intergenerational transmission of trauma and maladaptive relational patterns.",
