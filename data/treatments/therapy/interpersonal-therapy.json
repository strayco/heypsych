  "summary": "A structured, time-limited psychotherapy that focuses on improving interpersonal relationships and social functioning to alleviate psychological distress.",
  "description": "Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) is an evidence-based, time-limited treatment originally developed for major depressive disorder. It emphasizes the role of interpersonal relationships, social support, and life events in the onset and maintenance of psychological symptoms. IPT helps patients identify and address problem areas in relationships, such as role disputes, role transitions, grief, and interpersonal deficits. Through structured sessions, patients learn strategies to improve communication, resolve conflicts, and build stronger social support, which in turn reduces psychiatric symptoms.",
