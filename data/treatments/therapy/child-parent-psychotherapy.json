  "summary": "An evidence-based, relationship-focused therapy for young children and their caregivers, designed to address the impact of trauma, attachment disruptions, and behavioral or emotional difficulties.",
  "description": "Child–Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) is a dyadic, attachment-based therapeutic intervention that focuses on strengthening the relationship between a young child (typically ages 0–6) and their caregiver. Developed by Alicia Lieberman and colleagues, CPP integrates attachment theory, developmental psychology, trauma theory, and cognitive–behavioral techniques. It is particularly indicated for families who have experienced trauma, domestic violence, loss, or attachment difficulties. Treatment involves joint caregiver–child sessions, with an emphasis on improving communication, repairing disruptions in attachment, and promoting emotional regulation. CPP has a strong evidence base demonstrating effectiveness in reducing child behavioral and emotional symptoms, improving attachment security, and supporting caregiver mental health.",
