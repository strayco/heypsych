It focuses on repairing ruptures in parent–child relationships that contribute to adolescent depression and suicidal ideation. By fostering secure attachment, emotional openness, and trust, ABFT helps adolescents develop resilience and reduces psychological distress. Treatment is structured, emotion-focused, and designed for adolescents and their families.",
