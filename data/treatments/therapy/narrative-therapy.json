  "summary": "Narrative Therapy is a collaborative, strengths-based therapeutic approach that helps individuals separate themselves from their problems and re-author their personal stories in ways that promote resilience, empowerment, and meaning.",
  "description": "Narrative Therapy is a postmodern therapeutic approach rooted in the idea that people understand their lives through stories. It emphasizes that problems do not reside within people but in the stories they carry. Therapists help clients externalize problems, view them from different perspectives, and construct alternative narratives that align with their values, strengths, and goals. Developed by Michael White and David Epston, Narrative Therapy is widely used for individuals, families, and communities facing challenges such as depression, trauma, anxiety, relationship difficulties, and identity struggles.",
