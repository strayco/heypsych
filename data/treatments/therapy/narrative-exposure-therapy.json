  "description": "Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is an evidence-based, short-term therapeutic approach specifically developed for survivors of complex trauma, including war, torture, natural disasters, and chronic interpersonal violence. The therapy guides individuals in constructing a detailed chronological narrative of their entire life, emphasizing traumatic experiences but contextualizing them within the broader scope of positive and neutral life events. By externalizing and contextualizing trauma memories, NET aims to reduce intrusive symptoms, foster emotional integration, and restore continuity in personal identity. It is particularly effective in populations with cumulative trauma and is suitable for group or individual delivery.",
