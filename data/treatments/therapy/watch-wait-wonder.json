  "description": "Watch, Wait, and Wonder (WWW) is a dyadic parent-infant therapy designed to improve parent-child attachment and emotional connection. The intervention involves parents observing (‘watch’), allowing the child to take the lead (‘wait’), and reflecting on the interaction with the therapist (‘wonder’). Parents are encouraged to play with their child on the floor, following the child’s cues, while the therapist helps them reflect on their own and their child’s emotional experiences. This process strengthens parental sensitivity, improves reflective functioning, and enhances the parent-infant relationship. WWW has been shown to reduce attachment insecurity, improve emotional regulation in children, and increase caregiver attunement.",
