  "summary": "Prolonged Exposure Therapy is a structured, evidence-based cognitive-behavioral treatment designed to help individuals confront and process trauma-related memories, feelings, and situations to reduce PTSD symptoms.",
  "description": "Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE) is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) developed by Dr. Edna Foa for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The therapy involves repeatedly revisiting trauma memories (imaginal exposure) and gradually approaching safe but trauma-related reminders (in vivo exposure). Through repeated, guided exposure, patients process the traumatic event, reduce avoidance behaviors, and decrease distress associated with trauma cues. PE is considered a gold-standard treatment for PTSD and has strong empirical support across populations, including veterans, survivors of assault, and individuals exposed to accidents or disasters.",
