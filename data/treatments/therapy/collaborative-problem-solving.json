  "summary": "A parent–child intervention that emphasizes empathy, collaboration, and skill-building rather than punishment to address challenging behaviors in children.",
  "description": "Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS), developed by Dr. Ross Greene and Dr. Stuart Ablon, is a parent-training and therapeutic approach designed to help children with oppositional, defiant, or explosive behaviors. CPS is based on the principle that 'children do well if they can,' emphasizing that challenging behaviors arise from lagging cognitive skills such as flexibility, frustration tolerance, and problem-solving. Instead of relying on traditional consequences or rewards, CPS engages children and caregivers in a structured problem-solving process to build skills and strengthen relationships. It is widely applied in clinical, educational, and family contexts.",
