  "summary": "A structured, evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy developed to help individuals recover from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related conditions by addressing maladaptive trauma-related thoughts.",
  "description": "Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a manualized, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral treatment primarily used for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It was originally developed for survivors of sexual assault but has since been widely applied to military veterans, first responders, and other trauma survivors. CPT helps individuals identify and challenge maladaptive trauma-related beliefs (e.g., about safety, trust, power, control, self-worth, and intimacy). By restructuring these cognitions, CPT reduces symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal. CPT is typically delivered in 12 structured sessions and can be conducted individually or in group settings.",
