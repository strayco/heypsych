  "summary": "Trauma-Focused Family Therapy (TFFT) is an integrative approach that addresses the impact of trauma within the entire family system, helping both children and caregivers heal and build resilience together.",
  "description": "Trauma-Focused Family Therapy (TFFT) is a therapeutic intervention designed to treat the effects of trauma in children and adolescents by involving the family as a whole. Unlike individual trauma-focused therapies, TFFT emphasizes the role of family relationships, communication, and support systems in recovery. The approach integrates principles from cognitive-behavioral therapy, family systems theory, and trauma-informed care. Sessions typically include psychoeducation about trauma, skill development in emotional regulation and coping, and structured family dialogue to process traumatic experiences collectively. TFFT seeks to reduce PTSD symptoms in children, improve caregiver functioning, and restore healthier family dynamics.",
