  "summary": "Psychoeducational groups are structured group interventions that combine education with therapeutic support, helping participants learn about mental health conditions, coping strategies, and skill development in a supportive setting.",
  "description": "Psychoeducational groups focus on teaching participants about mental health, emotional regulation, coping strategies, and interpersonal skills while also providing peer support. These groups are structured, goal-oriented, and often facilitated by trained clinicians. They may target specific conditions such as depression, anxiety, trauma, or substance use, or address life skills, parenting, and relapse prevention. Unlike purely process-oriented groups, psychoeducational groups emphasize learning, practice, and practical application of skills, blending elements of education and therapy.",
