  "description": "Authoritative Parenting Training is a psychoeducational and therapeutic intervention that teaches parents to adopt the authoritative parenting style—characterized by warmth, responsiveness, and consistent, firm but fair discipline. Research shows this parenting style is linked to improved outcomes in children and adolescents, including better emotional regulation, academic performance, and lower rates of conduct problems. Training often includes modeling, role-play, skill-building, and guided practice for parents.",
