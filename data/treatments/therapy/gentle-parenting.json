  "summary": "A parenting approach emphasizing empathy, respect, boundaries, and guidance rather than punishment, designed to nurture secure attachment and positive child development.",
  "description": "Gentle Parenting is a modern, non-punitive parenting philosophy that focuses on empathy, respect, and understanding between parent and child. It encourages parents to view children as individuals with valid feelings, supporting emotional regulation and positive behavior through connection, consistency, and mutual respect. Instead of using punishment or rewards as primary motivators, Gentle Parenting emphasizes collaboration, communication, and guidance to help children develop intrinsic motivation, emotional intelligence, and resilience. It draws from attachment theory, positive discipline, and developmental psychology, and is increasingly popular among parents seeking alternatives to authoritarian or permissive styles.",
