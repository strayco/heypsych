  "summary": "A structured, parent-mediated play therapy that trains caregivers to conduct child-centered therapeutic play sessions to improve behavior, emotion regulation, and parent–child attachment.",
  "description": "Filial Therapy integrates principles of Child-Centered Play Therapy (CCPT) with systematic parent coaching so that caregivers provide the therapeutic play in brief, recurring 'special playtimes' at home. Therapists teach parents nondirective play skills—empathic reflection, limit setting, tracking, and encouragement—while modeling sessions and providing live coaching. The approach strengthens attachment, enhances parental attunement, and gives children a safe, mastery-oriented space to process emotions and experiences. Because therapy is delivered by parents between clinic visits, filial models can generalize gains across home and school settings and are practical for families seeking developmentally sensitive, relationship-based care.",
