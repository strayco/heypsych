  "summary": "An evidence-based psychotherapy that integrates cognitive-behavioral techniques with mindfulness practices to prevent relapse in depression and improve emotional regulation.",
  "description": "Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) combines the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy with mindfulness meditation practices to help individuals better manage thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Originally developed to prevent relapse in major depressive disorder, MBCT emphasizes awareness of present-moment experiences, acceptance of difficult emotions, and decentering from negative thought patterns. It is typically delivered in a group format over 8 weeks, with structured mindfulness exercises, psychoeducation, and cognitive strategies to reduce vulnerability to depression and stress.",
