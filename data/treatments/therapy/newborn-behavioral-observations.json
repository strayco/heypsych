  "summary": "The Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) system is a relationship-based, family-centered tool that helps parents understand their newborn’s communication, behavior, and unique characteristics, fostering stronger parent-infant bonding and responsive caregiving.",
  "description": "The Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) system is an individualized, interactive clinical tool designed to enhance the relationship between parents and their newborns. Developed by Dr. T. Berry Brazelton and colleagues, the NBO builds on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) but is designed to be shorter, more practical, and clinically accessible. It focuses on 18 observable newborn behaviors that illustrate the baby’s strengths, preferences, and sensitivities. The process is collaborative and supportive, encouraging parents to interpret and respond to their infant’s cues, promoting sensitive caregiving and attachment. The NBO is typically delivered by trained clinicians, nurses, or early intervention specialists in hospitals, clinics, or home settings.",
