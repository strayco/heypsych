  "summary": "An evidence-based, family-focused intervention that helps parents and caregivers of at-risk youth build positive parenting practices, improve communication, and reduce behavioral and emotional problems in children.",
  "description": "Functional Family Therapy for Parenting (FFT-Parenting) is a structured, short-term therapeutic model adapted from Functional Family Therapy (FFT). It emphasizes improving parent–child relationships, enhancing parenting skills, and addressing family dynamics that contribute to child and adolescent behavioral issues. The therapy integrates cognitive-behavioral, systemic, and relational techniques to help parents reframe negative interactions, implement effective discipline, and foster resilience. FFT-Parenting has been used with families at risk for child maltreatment, youth behavioral disorders, and other relational challenges, with strong evidence for reducing disruptive behaviors and preventing out-of-home placements.",
