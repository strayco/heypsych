  "description": "Brief Dynamic Therapy (BDT) is a short-term psychodynamic intervention that emphasizes identifying and resolving core unconscious conflicts that contribute to emotional distress and maladaptive behavior. It draws from classical psychoanalysis but condenses treatment into a focused, goal-directed format, typically lasting 12–40 sessions. BDT helps patients recognize repeating relational patterns, enhance emotional awareness, and work through defenses to achieve symptom relief and improved functioning. The therapy maintains the psychodynamic emphasis on transference, unconscious processes, and emotional expression, while applying structured, time-limited goals.",
