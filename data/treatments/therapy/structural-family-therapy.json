  "summary": "Structural Family Therapy is a therapeutic approach developed by Salvador Minuchin that focuses on restructuring family organization and boundaries to improve family functioning and resolve individual and relational problems.",
  "description": "Structural Family Therapy (SFT) was developed in the 1960s by psychiatrist Salvador Minuchin. It emphasizes the structure of the family system — its hierarchy, boundaries, and subsystems — as a central factor influencing individual and relational health. The therapist works actively with families to identify dysfunctional patterns, realign roles, and strengthen boundaries. Through direct engagement, role-playing, and restructuring interventions, SFT seeks to create healthier family dynamics and improve functioning across the family unit. It is widely used in the treatment of child and adolescent behavioral problems, family conflict, and psychosomatic disorders.",
