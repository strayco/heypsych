  "summary": "A collaborative problem-solving therapy designed to help children with chronic frustration, inflexibility, and explosive behavior by teaching skills in flexibility, frustration tolerance, and problem-solving.",
  "description": "The Explosive Child Approach, developed by Dr. Ross Greene and detailed in his book 'The Explosive Child,' is a therapeutic model emphasizing collaboration and proactive problem-solving between caregivers and children. Known formally as Collaborative & Proactive Solutions (CPS), this approach shifts away from traditional reward/punishment models and instead focuses on identifying and addressing underlying lagging skills. By involving children in identifying problems and working on mutually satisfying solutions, the approach reduces conflict, builds trust, and helps children develop self-regulation and problem-solving capacities.",
