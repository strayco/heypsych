  "description": "Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC), also called Treatment Foster Care Oregon (TFCO), is an evidence-based intervention for children and adolescents with chronic delinquency, severe emotional or behavioral disorders, or those at risk of placement in institutional care. Developed by Patricia Chamberlain and colleagues, MTFC places youth in specially trained foster homes with structured support, individualized behavioral programs, family therapy, and close monitoring. The model emphasizes reinforcement of prosocial behaviors, consistent limits, school support, and engagement with biological families to prepare for reunification when possible.",
