  "summary": "An intensive, evidence-based, home- and community-based treatment program for adolescents with serious behavioral, emotional, and criminal problems, focusing on the multiple systems that influence their development.",
  "description": "Multisystemic Therapy (MST) is a family- and community-based treatment designed for adolescents at risk of incarceration or out-of-home placement due to severe antisocial behavior, conduct problems, or substance use. Grounded in ecological and systems theory, MST addresses the many factors influencing a youth’s behavior, including family, peers, school, and neighborhood. The program empowers caregivers with the skills and resources to manage their child’s behavior, improve family functioning, reduce association with deviant peers, enhance school performance, and promote pro-social community involvement. MST is typically delivered in the home with intensive therapist involvement and 24/7 availability for crises.",
