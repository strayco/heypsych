  "summary": "Psychoanalysis is a long-term, intensive form of talk therapy developed by Sigmund Freud, focused on exploring unconscious conflicts, childhood experiences, and repressed emotions to promote insight and psychological healing.",
  "description": "Psychoanalysis is one of the earliest forms of psychotherapy, founded by Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century. It is based on the theory that unconscious processes, unresolved childhood conflicts, and repressed emotions shape current behavior and mental health. The therapy aims to bring unconscious material to conscious awareness through free association, dream interpretation, and analysis of transference. Psychoanalysis is typically intensive, involving multiple sessions per week over several years, and is designed to foster deep insight, personality restructuring, and long-term change.",
