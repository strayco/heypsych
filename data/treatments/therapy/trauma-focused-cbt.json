  "description": "Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is a structured, short-term therapeutic approach that integrates trauma-sensitive interventions with cognitive-behavioral, family, and humanistic principles. It is primarily used for children and adolescents who have experienced trauma, including abuse, violence, or disasters, and who are experiencing symptoms of PTSD, depression, or anxiety. TF-CBT involves both the child and their caregivers, with a focus on psychoeducation, coping skills, trauma narrative development, and gradual exposure to traumatic memories. The approach also emphasizes family involvement to support recovery and improve communication.",
