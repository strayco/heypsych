  "summary": "A psychosensory therapeutic approach that uses touch, eye movements, and visualization to reduce distressing emotions and reprocess traumatic memories.",
  "description": "Havening Techniques, also called Delta Wave Techniques, are a set of psychosensory interventions that aim to alter thought patterns and emotional responses through the application of soothing touch (typically on the arms, face, or hands), guided imagery, and distraction exercises. The method is designed to generate delta brain waves, promoting relaxation and neuroplastic changes. Havening is often used for trauma, anxiety, phobias, and stress management. It is considered a complementary therapy and is typically delivered by trained practitioners.",
