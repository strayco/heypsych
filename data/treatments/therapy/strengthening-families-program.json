  "description": "The Strengthening Families Program (SFP) is a family-centered intervention created in the 1980s by Dr. Karol Kumpfer. It aims to enhance family resilience, improve communication, and reduce risk behaviors in youth through structured sessions involving parents, children, and families together. The program combines behavioral training, skills development, and positive reinforcement techniques to address risk and protective factors related to substance use, delinquency, and mental health challenges. It has multiple adaptations for different age groups and cultural settings.",
