  "summary": "Positive Discipline is a parenting and educational approach that emphasizes mutual respect, encouragement, and collaborative problem-solving to foster responsibility, self-discipline, and cooperation in children.",
  "description": "Positive Discipline, developed by Dr. Jane Nelsen and based on the work of Alfred Adler and Rudolf Dreikurs, is a model that helps parents and educators use respectful, non-punitive strategies to guide children's behavior. It focuses on teaching long-term social and life skills by encouraging responsibility, empathy, cooperation, and problem-solving. The approach rejects rewards and punishments in favor of strategies like encouragement, natural and logical consequences, family meetings, and respectful communication. Positive Discipline is widely used in parenting programs, schools, and counseling to build stronger relationships while promoting children’s sense of belonging and capability.",
