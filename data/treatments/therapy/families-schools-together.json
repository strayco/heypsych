  "description": "Families and Schools Together (FAST) is a structured, evidence-based, multi-family intervention aimed at preventing school failure, substance abuse, juvenile delinquency, and child abuse. The program brings together parents, children, teachers, and community members in weekly sessions that combine family-strengthening activities, parent empowerment, social support, and school engagement. FAST emphasizes building protective factors in children through enhanced family functioning, improved parent–child relationships, and stronger school–family connections. It is often implemented in schools, community centers, or social service agencies.",
