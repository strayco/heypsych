  "summary": "Wraparound Services is a comprehensive, individualized care coordination approach designed to support children, adolescents, and families with complex mental health, behavioral, or social needs.",
  "description": "Wraparound Services is a holistic, community-based care model that integrates mental health, social services, educational supports, and family involvement into one individualized plan. The approach emphasizes collaboration across systems (schools, healthcare, child welfare, juvenile justice) and empowers families by centering their strengths and voice in decision-making. A dedicated care coordinator and team—including professionals, family members, and community supports—develop and monitor a plan tailored to the child and family’s needs. Wraparound is designed to reduce fragmentation of services, prevent out-of-home placements, and promote stability and well-being. It is commonly used for children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances, behavioral challenges, or multi-system involvement.",
