  "description": "Cognitive Therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) is a trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to help individuals process and recover from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Developed by Anke Ehlers and David Clark, CT-PTSD emphasizes identifying and modifying distorted appraisals of the trauma and its consequences, reducing unhelpful coping strategies (e.g., avoidance, rumination), and updating trauma memories to reduce distress. CT-PTSD is recommended as a first-line treatment for PTSD in multiple clinical guidelines and has strong empirical support.",
