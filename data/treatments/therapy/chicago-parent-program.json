  "description": "The Chicago Parent Program (CPP) is a group-based parenting intervention developed with input from African American and Latino parents to ensure cultural relevance and accessibility. It emphasizes positive parenting strategies such as praise, encouragement, and consistent discipline, while reducing harsh or inconsistent practices. The program is delivered in small groups using video vignettes, group discussion, and home practice assignments. CPP has been shown to improve child behavior, increase parenting confidence, and reduce parenting stress across diverse populations, including low-income families.",
