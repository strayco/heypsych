  "description": "Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) is a form of psychotherapy that integrates elements of eye movement therapies, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and guided imagery. ART uses sets of therapist-directed eye movements combined with visualization techniques to help patients replace distressing images and sensations with positive ones. Research suggests ART can quickly reduce symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and phobias, often in fewer sessions than traditional therapies.",
