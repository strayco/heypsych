  "summary": "A family therapy approach based on Murray Bowen's theory that views the family as an emotional unit and emphasizes differentiation of self within the family system.",
  "description": "Bowen Family Systems Therapy, developed by psychiatrist Murray Bowen, is a long-term therapeutic model that conceptualizes the family as an interdependent emotional system. It emphasizes how patterns of interaction and anxiety are transmitted across generations and how individual functioning is shaped by family dynamics. A central concept is differentiation of self — the ability to maintain one's identity while remaining emotionally connected to the family. The therapy seeks to reduce anxiety, resolve relationship difficulties, and improve family functioning by addressing intergenerational patterns, triangulation, and emotional cutoff.",
