  "description": "Family Preservation Services (FPS) are structured, evidence-based interventions that provide intensive, home-based support to families experiencing crises that put children at risk of removal. These services focus on keeping families together whenever safely possible by addressing immediate crises, improving parenting skills, enhancing family relationships, and connecting families with community resources. FPS practitioners typically offer 24/7 availability, flexible scheduling, and hands-on guidance tailored to each family’s needs.",
