  "description": "Love and Logic is a parenting program developed by Jim Fay and Foster Cline that integrates warmth, empathy, and structure to help parents raise responsible, respectful, and independent children. The model emphasizes giving children choices within limits, allowing them to experience the natural consequences of their actions, and maintaining strong, supportive parent–child relationships. By combining loving guidance with logical consequences, the approach aims to promote self-control, accountability, and positive behavior.",
