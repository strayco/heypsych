  "summary": "Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC) is a structured, family-based treatment for children and adolescents with serious emotional, behavioral, or mental health needs, providing individualized care in a supportive foster home setting.",
  "description": "Therapeutic Foster Care is an intensive, evidence-informed intervention designed for children and adolescents with significant emotional or behavioral challenges who cannot remain safely in their biological homes. Unlike traditional foster care, TFC involves specially trained foster parents who provide structured, nurturing, and therapeutic support. The model integrates individualized treatment planning, close supervision, mental health services, and collaboration between caregivers, clinicians, and agencies. Its goal is to reduce psychiatric hospitalizations, stabilize children in a family setting, and promote healthy development and reintegration into the community or family.",
