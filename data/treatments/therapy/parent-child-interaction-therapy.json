  "summary": "Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is a structured, evidence-based intervention that improves parent-child relationships, reduces disruptive behaviors in children, and enhances positive parenting skills.",
  "description": "Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an evidence-based behavioral parent training program designed for families with young children (typically ages 2–7) who display disruptive behaviors such as aggression, defiance, tantrums, or hyperactivity. The therapy involves live coaching of parents while they interact with their child, often through a one-way mirror and earpiece system, with a therapist providing real-time guidance. PCIT has two main phases: Child-Directed Interaction (CDI), which enhances the parent-child relationship through positive attention and play, and Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI), which teaches effective discipline and limit-setting strategies. The approach strengthens attachment, improves behavior regulation, and fosters healthier family dynamics.",
