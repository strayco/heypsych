  "summary": "Reality Therapy is a counseling approach that focuses on personal responsibility, choice, and present-focused problem-solving, helping clients fulfill their basic psychological needs in constructive ways.",
  "description": "Developed by psychiatrist William Glasser in the 1960s, Reality Therapy is grounded in Choice Theory, which emphasizes that human behavior is driven by attempts to satisfy five basic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun. The therapy focuses on the present and future rather than dwelling on the past. It encourages clients to take responsibility for their actions, evaluate whether their current behaviors meet their needs effectively, and make better choices that align with their goals and values. The therapeutic process avoids labeling mental illness and instead emphasizes building effective relationships and practical solutions.",
