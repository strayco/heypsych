  "summary": "Supportive therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on strengthening coping skills, offering reassurance, and fostering resilience without delving deeply into unconscious processes.",
  "description": "Supportive therapy is a therapeutic approach that emphasizes emotional support, encouragement, guidance, and problem-solving to help individuals manage psychological distress. Unlike insight-oriented therapies, supportive therapy does not seek to uncover unconscious conflicts but instead aims to enhance coping strategies, improve self-esteem, and provide a stabilizing, safe therapeutic relationship. It is widely used for patients with chronic mental illness, those in crisis, or individuals who may not be ready for or suited to intensive psychodynamic or cognitive-behavioral interventions.",
