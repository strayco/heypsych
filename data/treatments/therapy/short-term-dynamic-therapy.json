  "summary": "Short-Term Dynamic Therapy (STDT) is a time-limited psychodynamic approach that focuses on resolving unconscious emotional conflicts and maladaptive patterns within a structured, brief timeframe.",
  "description": "Short-Term Dynamic Therapy (STDT) is a psychodynamic intervention designed to help individuals quickly access and process unconscious emotions, reduce maladaptive defense mechanisms, and develop healthier interpersonal patterns. Unlike traditional psychoanalysis, which can last for years, STDT is focused, goal-oriented, and usually completed within a limited number of sessions. The therapist helps the client identify underlying emotional conflicts, particularly those related to attachment and early life experiences, and facilitates insight to promote lasting change.",
