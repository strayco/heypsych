  "summary": "Video Interaction Guidance is a therapeutic intervention that uses video feedback to help parents, caregivers, or professionals reflect on and improve communication and relationships.",
  "description": "Video Interaction Guidance (VIG) is a strengths-based, evidence-informed therapeutic approach that involves recording short video clips of everyday interactions between a parent (or caregiver) and child. A trained VIG practitioner then reviews the clips with the parent, focusing on moments of attuned interaction, positive communication, and shared understanding. By highlighting successful interactions, parents become more aware of their own strengths and develop confidence in their ability to connect with and support their child. VIG is widely used in child development, education, and family support contexts, and it has applications in social work, healthcare, and therapy. It emphasizes empowerment, self-reflection, and relationship-building rather than problem-focused approaches.",
