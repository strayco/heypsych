  "description": "Person-Centered Therapy (PCT), also known as Client-Centered or Rogerian Therapy, is a humanistic therapeutic approach that focuses on creating a supportive and nonjudgmental environment where clients can explore their feelings, experiences, and values. Developed by Carl Rogers, PCT is grounded in the belief that individuals have an innate tendency toward growth and self-actualization when provided with the right conditions: empathy, unconditional positive regard, and genuineness from the therapist. Unlike more directive therapies, PCT avoids giving advice or interpretation, instead emphasizing the therapeutic relationship as the primary driver of change.",
