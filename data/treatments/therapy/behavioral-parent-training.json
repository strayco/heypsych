  "summary": "An evidence-based therapy that trains parents in behavioral strategies to manage child behavior problems, particularly disruptive behaviors and ADHD.",
  "description": "Behavioral Parent Training (BPT), also called Parent Management Training (PMT), is a structured intervention that teaches parents strategies to reinforce desirable child behavior, reduce disruptive behaviors, and improve parent–child relationships. Rooted in behavioral principles, it uses modeling, role-play, and homework practice. BPT has extensive evidence for reducing oppositional, aggressive, and noncompliant behaviors in children, and is considered a first-line treatment for ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders.",
