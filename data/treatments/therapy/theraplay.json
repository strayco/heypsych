  "summary": "Theraplay is a child and family therapy that focuses on building and enhancing attachment, self-esteem, trust in others, and joyful engagement through structured play-based activities.",
  "description": "Theraplay is an attachment-based therapeutic approach designed to improve parent-child relationships through playful, engaging, and nurturing interactions. It is grounded in attachment theory, intersubjectivity, and developmental psychology. The therapist guides structured activities that are fun, physical, and emotionally attuned, aiming to strengthen the parent-child bond, build trust, encourage emotional regulation, and promote secure attachment. Unlike nondirective play therapy, Theraplay is therapist-led and actively involves parents or caregivers to foster long-term relational improvements.",
