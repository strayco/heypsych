  "summary": "Strategic Family Therapy is a structured, problem-focused approach to family counseling that aims to change dysfunctional interaction patterns and resolve presenting problems within families.",
  "description": "Strategic Family Therapy (SFT) is a therapeutic model developed in the 1970s at the Mental Research Institute (MRI) in Palo Alto and further refined by Salvador Minuchin and Jay Haley. It focuses on identifying dysfunctional family interaction patterns and creating targeted interventions to disrupt them. SFT is directive, time-limited, and goal-oriented, often using reframing, paradoxical interventions, and tasks assigned to family members between sessions. The therapy addresses family dynamics directly, emphasizing solutions rather than deep exploration of past causes.",
