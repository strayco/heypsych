  "summary": "Process groups are a form of group therapy that emphasizes open exploration of thoughts, feelings, and interpersonal dynamics among members, fostering insight, emotional growth, and improved relationships.",
  "description": "Process groups, also called interpersonal process groups, are a therapeutic approach where individuals meet in a group setting, facilitated by a therapist, to explore emotions, behaviors, and relational patterns in the here-and-now. Unlike structured psychoeducational groups, process groups focus on spontaneous interactions and feedback between members. The therapist helps participants notice interpersonal patterns, enhance self-awareness, and practice new ways of relating. This method is widely used in outpatient therapy, residential treatment, and academic counseling centers for issues such as depression, anxiety, relationship difficulties, trauma, and personal growth.",
