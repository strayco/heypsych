  "description": "Group therapy involves one or more therapists working with several people at the same time. It provides a safe, structured environment for individuals to share experiences, gain support, and practice new behaviors. The group dynamic fosters learning from others’ perspectives, reduces isolation, and builds interpersonal skills. Sessions may be structured (e.g., skills training) or process-oriented (e.g., exploring emotions and interactions). Groups can be tailored to specific concerns, such as depression, trauma, addiction, or social skills.",
