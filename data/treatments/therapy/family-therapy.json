  "summary": "A form of psychotherapy that helps families improve communication, resolve conflicts, and strengthen relationships by addressing patterns of interaction within the family system.",
  "description": "Family Therapy is a structured therapeutic approach that focuses on improving the functioning of families by examining relational dynamics and communication patterns. Unlike individual therapy, family therapy involves multiple family members working together with a therapist to identify problematic interactions and develop healthier ways of relating. It may draw on systemic, structural, strategic, or integrative models depending on the family's needs. The goal is to support family members in understanding one another, resolving conflicts, and enhancing coping strategies for challenges such as mental illness, behavioral problems, or life transitions.",
