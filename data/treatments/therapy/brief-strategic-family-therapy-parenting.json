  "summary": "A time-limited, evidence-based family therapy that strengthens parenting practices and restructures family interaction patterns to reduce adolescent externalizing behaviors and substance use.",
  "description": "Brief Strategic Family Therapy – Parenting (BSFT-P) is an adaptation of Brief Strategic Family Therapy that concentrates on empowering caregivers with clear, consistent, and effective parenting while reorganizing family interactions that maintain problem behaviors. Rooted in strategic and structural family therapy, BSFT-P uses active joining, reframing, and in-session coaching to modify maladaptive patterns (e.g., permissiveness, coercive cycles, weak boundaries). The approach is highly pragmatic: it targets engagement first, strengthens parental leadership, and aligns the entire family around developmentally appropriate expectations. BSFT-P has been used in outpatient clinics, schools, and community programs to address conduct problems, oppositionality, truancy, and early substance use.",

Reframing reduces blame and mobilizes the family toward clear, developmentally appropriate rules and routines. As maladaptive sequences are interrupted and parental leadership is restored, reinforcement contingencies shift and externalizing behaviors decline."
