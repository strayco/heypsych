  "summary": "Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) is a family-based behavioral treatment designed to improve social, emotional, and flexible thinking skills, particularly for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",
  "description": "Developed by Dr. Steven Gutstein, Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) is a parent-led therapy model focusing on strengthening the dynamic aspects of intelligence such as adaptability, problem-solving, social referencing, and emotional connection. RDI emphasizes guided participation, where parents are trained to help their children learn flexible thinking, build strong social and emotional bonds, and generalize skills across settings. Unlike traditional skill-based programs, RDI focuses on the quality of relationships and the developmental process of social growth.",
