  "description": "Functional Family Therapy (FFT) is a structured, family-focused intervention originally developed in the 1970s to treat adolescents with behavioral, emotional, or substance use problems. FFT combines systemic family therapy, cognitive-behavioral strategies, and motivational techniques to help families reframe negative interaction patterns, improve problem-solving, and strengthen supportive relationships. The therapy is typically delivered in 12–30 sessions over 3–6 months and has been widely adopted in community mental health and juvenile justice settings. Research shows FFT effectively reduces delinquency, substance abuse, and out-of-home placements while improving family cohesion and communication.",
