  "description": "Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT) is a comprehensive, developmentally informed, and evidence-based intervention designed for adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders, behavioral problems, or emotional difficulties. Developed by Howard A. Liddle, MDFT addresses multiple domains of functioning, including the individual, family, peers, and community, with the goal of reducing substance use, improving family functioning, and enhancing overall well-being. The therapy integrates elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy, family systems, and developmental psychology, and has been tested extensively in randomized controlled trials.",
