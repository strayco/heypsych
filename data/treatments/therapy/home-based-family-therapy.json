  "description": "Home-Based Family Therapy is a flexible, community-based intervention that provides therapy services to families within their home environment. This approach allows therapists to observe family interactions in real time, address challenges in their natural setting, and tailor strategies to the specific needs of the household. Home-based therapy is often used for families with at-risk youth, child welfare involvement, or those facing barriers to accessing traditional outpatient care. It integrates elements from structural, strategic, and systemic family therapy models, with an emphasis on improving communication, parenting practices, conflict resolution, and family stability.",
