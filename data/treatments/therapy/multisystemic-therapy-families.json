  "description": "Multisystemic Therapy (MST) for Families is an intensive, family- and community-based treatment that addresses the serious clinical, social, and behavioral challenges of adolescents at risk for out-of-home placement due to delinquency, conduct disorder, substance use, or other severe behavioral problems. MST integrates cognitive-behavioral, family systems, and ecological approaches, working with caregivers, schools, peers, and community systems to build sustainable support. Treatment is delivered in the home, is highly individualized, and emphasizes empowering parents to manage their child’s behavior effectively while reducing reliance on formal systems.",
