  "summary": "Parent Management Training (PMT) is an evidence-based behavioral intervention that teaches parents strategies to improve child behavior, reduce disruptive conduct, and strengthen positive family relationships.",
  "description": "Parent Management Training (PMT) is a structured, skills-based therapy that helps parents develop effective strategies for managing their child’s behavioral problems. Rooted in social learning theory and cognitive-behavioral principles, PMT focuses on reinforcing prosocial behaviors, reducing oppositional and defiant behaviors, and improving the parent-child relationship. Parents learn to use consistent discipline, positive reinforcement, and effective communication techniques to guide their child’s behavior. PMT is one of the most widely studied interventions for conduct problems, ADHD, and oppositional defiant disorder, and has been shown to reduce disruptive behaviors and improve family functioning.",
