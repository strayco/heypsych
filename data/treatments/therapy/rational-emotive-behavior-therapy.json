  "summary": "Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that helps individuals identify and challenge irrational beliefs, replacing them with more rational, constructive thoughts and behaviors.",
  "description": "Developed by Albert Ellis in the 1950s, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) emphasizes the role of beliefs in shaping emotions and behaviors. It is based on the premise that emotional distress often arises from irrational or rigid thinking patterns, rather than external events themselves. REBT helps individuals identify these irrational beliefs, dispute them through structured questioning, and replace them with rational, flexible, and self-supportive alternatives. The therapy uses the ABC model (Activating event, Beliefs, Consequences) to help clients understand how their thought patterns influence their emotions and actions.",
