  "summary": "A parenting and therapeutic approach that teaches children how to understand and regulate their emotions through validation, guidance, and skill-building.",
  "description": "Emotion Coaching is a parenting and therapeutic approach developed from the research of John Gottman and colleagues. It emphasizes recognizing and validating children's emotions while guiding them in problem-solving and self-regulation. Rather than dismissing or minimizing emotions, parents and caregivers use moments of emotional expression as opportunities for teaching and connection. Emotion Coaching involves helping children label their feelings, empathizing with them, and collaboratively developing appropriate responses. Over time, it fosters resilience, emotional intelligence, stronger parent-child bonds, and improved behavioral regulation.",
