  "summary": "A form of phototherapy that uses short-wavelength visible light to influence circadian rhythms, improve mood, and treat certain dermatologic conditions.",
  "description": "Blue light therapy involves exposure to light in the blue spectrum, typically between 450–495 nanometers, which has distinct biological effects compared to full-spectrum or white light. In mental health, blue light is primarily used for circadian rhythm modulation, seasonal affective disorder (SAD) treatment, and sleep-phase disorders by influencing melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells that project to the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).\n\nIn dermatology, high-intensity blue light is employed for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, often in acne treatment or as part of photodynamic therapy for certain precancerous skin lesions. The wavelength and intensity used in psychiatric versus dermatologic applications differ substantially, with psychiatric use focusing on safe daily exposure and dermatologic use often involving shorter, higher-intensity treatments.",
