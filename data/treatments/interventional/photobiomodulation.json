  "summary": "A non-invasive light therapy that uses red or near-infrared light to stimulate cellular activity, reduce inflammation, and promote tissue repair.",
  "description": "Photobiomodulation (PBM), also known as low-level laser therapy (LLLT) or red light therapy, is a non-invasive technique that uses specific wavelengths of red and near-infrared light to influence cellular metabolism. The therapy is thought to act through absorption by cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondria, leading to improved ATP production, modulation of reactive oxygen species, and upregulation of signaling pathways that promote healing and reduce inflammation. PBM is used across a variety of medical fields including neurology, psychiatry, dermatology, and rehabilitation medicine.",

Red and near-infrared photons are absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase, increasing electron transport chain activity and ATP production. This enhances cellular metabolism, reduces oxidative stress, and triggers downstream effects such as anti-inflammatory cytokine release, neurotrophic factor upregulation, and improved blood flow. In neurological applications, PBM may promote neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity."
