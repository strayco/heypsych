  "summary": "A noninvasive biofeedback modality that uses electrodermal activity (skin conductance) to train awareness and regulation of sympathetic arousal.",
  "description": "Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) biofeedback—also called electrodermal activity (EDA) biofeedback—measures changes in skin conductance associated with sweat gland activity, a sensitive marker of sympathetic nervous system arousal. Real-time visual and/or auditory feedback helps patients notice and modulate arousal states using paced breathing, relaxation, and cognitive strategies.\n\nClinically, GSR biofeedback is used to reduce stress and anxiety, improve emotion regulation, and support trauma recovery when integrated with evidence-based psychotherapies. It can also augment relaxation training for insomnia and somatic tension syndromes. Devices are recording-only (no current delivered) and are generally regulated as biofeedback/relaxation tools rather than for specific psychiatric indications.",
