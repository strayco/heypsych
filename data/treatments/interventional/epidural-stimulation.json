  "summary": "A neuromodulation technique involving the implantation of electrodes over the spinal cord's dura mater to deliver targeted electrical stimulation, used to manage chronic pain and aid motor recovery after spinal cord injury.",
  "description": "Epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) involves surgically implanting electrodes in the epidural space above the spinal cord to deliver electrical impulses. This therapy modulates nerve signals before they reach the brain, reducing chronic pain or enhancing motor function after neurological injury. It is typically reserved for patients who have not responded to conservative treatments.",
