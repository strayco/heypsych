  "summary": "An interventional therapy using implanted electrical stimulators to deliver pulses to the spinal cord, reducing chronic neuropathic and intractable pain.",
  "description": "Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) is a neuromodulation technique involving the implantation of a device that delivers mild electrical impulses to the spinal cord. These impulses modulate pain signaling pathways, often replacing pain sensations with a tingling or paresthesia-like feeling. SCS is widely used in managing chronic neuropathic pain, failed back surgery syndrome, and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). It is typically considered when conservative treatments and medications fail.",
