  "summary": "An interventional treatment involving targeted injection of botulinum toxin into the glabellar region, explored for psychiatric use in major depressive disorder and commonly used cosmetically to reduce frown lines.",
  "description": "Glabellar botulinum toxin injection involves administering botulinum toxin type A into the muscles of the glabellar region (between the eyebrows) to reduce hyperactivity of the corrugator and procerus muscles. While its primary use is cosmetic (to reduce frown lines), clinical trials have investigated its role in alleviating symptoms of major depressive disorder. The hypothesized mechanism is based on the facial feedback hypothesis, where reducing the ability to form negative facial expressions may improve mood states. This treatment is minimally invasive and performed in an outpatient setting.",
