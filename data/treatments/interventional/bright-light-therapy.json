  "summary": "A non-invasive phototherapy technique that uses high-intensity, full-spectrum or white light to regulate circadian rhythms and treat mood disorders, especially seasonal affective disorder (SAD).",
  "description": "Bright light therapy delivers controlled exposure to high-intensity light, typically between 2,500–10,000 lux, to influence circadian rhythms and improve mood. By stimulating intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, light signals are transmitted to the brain’s suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the body’s master clock, resulting in adjustments to melatonin and serotonin regulation.\n\nThis treatment is widely used for seasonal affective disorder, certain circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, and as an adjunct in non-seasonal depression. The therapy involves sitting near a specially designed light box each morning, usually during the fall and winter months, to simulate natural outdoor light exposure.\n\nBright light therapy is safe for most individuals when used as directed, though proper screening for ocular health and photosensitivity is recommended before starting treatment.",
