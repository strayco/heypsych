  "summary": "A non-invasive neuromodulation and lesioning technique using focused ultrasound waves to either modulate brain activity or ablate targeted tissue for conditions such as tremor and depression.",
  "description": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound (tFUS) is an emerging neuromodulation and neurosurgical technology that uses highly focused ultrasound beams delivered through the skull to specific brain regions. Depending on the intensity, tFUS can either transiently modulate neuronal activity or permanently ablate tissue. It is FDA-approved for essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease tremor, with ongoing research into psychiatric conditions such as depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Because it is incisionless, tFUS avoids many risks of open neurosurgery, but requires MRI guidance and specialized equipment.",
