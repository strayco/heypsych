  "description": "Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback is an advanced brain training method that provides individuals with live feedback on their brain activity in specific regions of interest. Unlike EEG-based neurofeedback, which reflects electrical activity at the scalp, rt-fMRI provides high spatial resolution and can target deep or localized brain areas. Patients are shown visual or auditory cues representing their brain activation patterns and are trained to modulate these signals through mental strategies. This approach is being explored as a treatment for psychiatric and neurological disorders.",
