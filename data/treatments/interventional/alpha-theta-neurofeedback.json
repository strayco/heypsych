  "summary": "A specialized neurofeedback protocol that trains the brain to produce alpha and theta brainwave states for deep relaxation and healing.",
  "description": "Alpha-theta neurofeedback is a passive form of neurofeedback that encourages the production of alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) brainwaves. This protocol is designed to access deep meditative states, enhance creativity, and facilitate emotional processing and trauma healing through brainwave entrainment.",
