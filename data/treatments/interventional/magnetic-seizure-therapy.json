  "description": "Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) is a neurostimulation technique that uses focused, high-intensity magnetic fields to induce a therapeutic seizure under anesthesia. It is designed to target specific brain regions while reducing the spread of stimulation to areas responsible for memory, potentially lowering cognitive side effects compared to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). MST is primarily being investigated for treatment-resistant mood disorders, especially {link:major-depressive-disorder} and {link:bipolar-disorder}.",
