  "summary": "A form of bright light therapy that uses specially designed lamps to alleviate symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder by simulating natural daylight exposure.",
  "description": "SAD lamp therapy is a light-based intervention for Seasonal Affective Disorder, a subtype of depression that occurs during winter months when daylight exposure is reduced. The therapy involves sitting near a lamp that emits bright, broad-spectrum light (usually 10,000 lux), which helps regulate circadian rhythms, melatonin secretion, and serotonin activity. This treatment is considered first-line for SAD and has strong evidence for improving mood, energy, and sleep in affected individuals.",
