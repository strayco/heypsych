  "summary": "An oral, sublingual, or buccal form of ketamine used for at-home or clinic-based maintenance therapy following initial ketamine treatment, primarily for mood disorders and chronic pain.",
  "description": "Ketamine troches are small, dissolvable lozenges containing ketamine, typically compounded by specialty pharmacies. They are placed under the tongue or between the cheek and gum to allow absorption through oral mucosa. Troches are often prescribed as part of a maintenance plan following in-clinic ketamine infusions or intramuscular injections, extending therapeutic benefits for depression, anxiety, PTSD, or chronic pain. They are used off-label in psychiatry and pain management, with dosing protocols tailored to individual tolerance and therapeutic goals.",
