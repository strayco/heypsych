  "summary": "A form of EEG-based neurofeedback training targeting enhancement or regulation of gamma brainwave activity (30–100 Hz) to improve cognitive function, attention, and mental clarity.",
  "description": "Gamma neurofeedback trains individuals to increase or regulate gamma frequency brain activity, which is associated with high-level cognitive processing, attention, working memory, and sensory integration. By providing real-time EEG feedback, participants learn to self-modulate gamma activity, potentially enhancing mental performance or addressing clinical symptoms.",
