  "description": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that delivers focused magnetic pulses to specific brain regions, most commonly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) can alter cortical excitability and functional connectivity, making it a well-established treatment for major depressive disorder and OCD. TMS is generally safe, performed in outpatient settings, and requires no anesthesia. Variants include intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and deep TMS (dTMS), which target different brain regions and reduce treatment time.",
