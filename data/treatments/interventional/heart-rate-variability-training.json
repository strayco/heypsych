  "summary": "A noninvasive biofeedback method that trains paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency to increase HRV coherence, improving autonomic balance, stress resilience, and emotional regulation.",
  "description": "HRV biofeedback (often called coherence training) uses sensors to measure beat-to-beat heart rate changes and provides real-time feedback to guide slow, diaphragmatic breathing near the individual's resonance frequency (~4.5–6.5 breaths/min). Training increases vagal tone and baroreflex sensitivity, promoting parasympathetic dominance and improved stress recovery.\n\nClinically, HRV training is used for anxiety and stress-related disorders, PTSD adjunctive care, insomnia, functional somatic syndromes, and performance optimization. Sessions combine breathing pacers, HRV coherence targets, and brief challenge–recovery drills to generalize self-regulation skills to daily life.",
