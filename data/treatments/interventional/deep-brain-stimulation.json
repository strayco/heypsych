  "summary": "A neurosurgical procedure that implants electrodes into specific brain regions to modulate abnormal neural activity, used for treatment-resistant movement and psychiatric disorders.",
  "description": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves the stereotactic surgical implantation of electrodes into targeted brain structures, connected via subcutaneous leads to a neurostimulator (implanted pulse generator). The device delivers continuous or programmed electrical pulses to modulate abnormal neural circuit activity.\n\nDBS is FDA-approved for movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, and more recently for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Research is ongoing for treatment-resistant depression, Tourette syndrome, and other neuropsychiatric conditions.\n\nUnlike ablative neurosurgery, DBS is adjustable and reversible, allowing fine-tuning of stimulation parameters and the possibility of device removal if necessary.",
