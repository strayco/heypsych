  "summary": "An interventional psychiatric treatment delivering ketamine intravenously for rapid relief of certain mood and pain disorders, particularly treatment-resistant depression.",
  "description": "IV ketamine infusion involves administering a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine via intravenous drip under medical supervision. It is known for its rapid onset antidepressant effects, often within hours, making it a promising option for treatment-resistant depression, suicidal ideation, and certain pain syndromes. Ketamine acts primarily as an NMDA receptor antagonist, leading to downstream effects on glutamate signaling, neuroplasticity, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release. Treatments are performed in clinical settings with continuous monitoring due to the potential for dissociation, cardiovascular effects, and other acute side effects.",
