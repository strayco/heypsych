  "summary": "EEG-based operant conditioning that trains beta-band activity (typically 12–20 Hz up-training and/or 22–30 Hz down-training) to modulate arousal, attention, and hyperarousal symptoms.",
  "description": "Beta neurofeedback is a form of EEG biofeedback in which real-time brainwave amplitudes are displayed to the patient and used to reinforce desired changes in cortical activity via operant conditioning. Protocols commonly reward low- to mid-beta activity (e.g., 15–18 Hz) and/or sensorimotor rhythm (SMR; 12–15 Hz), while inhibiting excess theta (4–7 Hz) and high-beta (22–30 Hz). The goal is to optimize arousal regulation, sustain attention, and reduce hyperarousal and anxiety.\n\nClinically, beta- and SMR-based protocols are most often applied in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and insomnia, with exploratory use for anxiety and performance optimization. Evidence suggests small-to-moderate benefits for ADHD symptoms in some trials and meta-analyses, though findings are mixed and protocol heterogeneity and expectancy effects complicate interpretation. For insomnia, SMR training shows promise in select studies, but double-blind work highlights substantial placebo responsiveness. Careful patient selection, standardized protocols, and integration with behavioral treatments (e.g., CBT-I, psychoeducation) are recommended.",
