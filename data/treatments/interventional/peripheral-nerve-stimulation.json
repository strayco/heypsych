  "summary": "A minimally invasive neuromodulation technique using implanted electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to targeted peripheral nerves, reducing pain signals and modulating neural activity.",
  "description": "Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is a neuromodulation therapy that delivers low-level electrical impulses to specific peripheral nerves through implanted electrodes. These pulses modulate pain signal transmission and can alter central nervous system pain processing. PNS is primarily used for chronic, localized neuropathic or musculoskeletal pain that has not responded adequately to conservative treatments. Modern PNS systems are designed to be minimally invasive, often percutaneous, and can be trialed before permanent implantation. The therapy is reversible and adjustable, making it an alternative to systemic medications or more invasive surgeries.",
