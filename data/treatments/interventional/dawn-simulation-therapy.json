  "summary": "A light-based intervention that gradually increases light intensity in the morning to simulate a natural sunrise, aiming to improve circadian rhythm alignment and mood.",
  "description": "Dawn simulation therapy uses a timed light device that gradually brightens over 30–90 minutes before a person wakes, mimicking the gradual light changes of a sunrise. This approach aims to gently shift the body's circadian rhythm, enhance morning alertness, and improve mood.\n\nUnlike bright light therapy, which uses high-intensity light shortly after waking, dawn simulation operates at lower lux levels (typically 100–300 lux at eye level) but over a longer ramp-up period. This gradual light increase can be less disruptive for light-sensitive individuals and may improve adherence.\n\nIt is most often applied in treating seasonal affective disorder (SAD), circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, and certain cases of non-seasonal depression.",
