  "summary": "An FDA-approved neuromodulation therapy that delivers mild electrical impulses to the vagus nerve via an implanted device, used in treatment-resistant epilepsy and depression.",
  "description": "Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) involves surgical implantation of a pulse generator under the skin of the chest, with a lead wire wrapped around the left vagus nerve in the neck. The device sends regular, mild electrical signals to the vagus nerve, which in turn modulates brain activity through widespread connections to the brainstem and limbic system. VNS is FDA-approved for epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression, with ongoing research exploring additional psychiatric and neurological indications.",
