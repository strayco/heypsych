  "summary": "A non-invasive brain stimulation technique that applies weak electrical currents to modulate neuronal excitability and improve symptoms in depression, anxiety, and other conditions.",
  "description": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive neuromodulation that uses constant, low-amplitude electrical currents delivered via scalp electrodes to alter cortical excitability. Unlike TMS, it does not induce action potentials but instead modulates neuronal firing thresholds. It has been investigated for depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and cognitive enhancement. tDCS is portable, relatively inexpensive, and well tolerated, though its clinical efficacy varies by condition and stimulation protocol.",
