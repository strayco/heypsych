  "summary": "A noninvasive biofeedback method that uses surface electromyography to teach voluntary control of skeletal muscle tension and activation patterns.",
  "description": "Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback records surface muscle activity and provides real-time visual and/or auditory feedback so patients can learn to down-regulate excessive tension or up-train weak or poorly recruited muscles. Through operant conditioning and repeated practice, EMG biofeedback promotes more efficient neuromuscular control and reduces pain or hyperarousal associated with chronic tension patterns.\n\nIn behavioral health, EMG biofeedback is most commonly applied to tension-type headache (frontalis, temporalis), migraine (pericranial co-contraction patterns), temporomandibular disorders and bruxism (masseter/temporalis), neck/shoulder myalgia (trapezius), and stress-related somatic symptoms. Evidence supports benefit for primary headaches and for adjunctive use in anxiety/stress management. EMG biofeedback devices are generally regulated in the U.S. as Class II biofeedback devices (often via 510(k)); they are cleared for biofeedback/relaxation training rather than specific psychiatric indications.",
