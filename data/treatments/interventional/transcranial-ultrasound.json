  "description": "Transcranial Ultrasound (TUS), also called low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), is an emerging brain stimulation method that uses acoustic energy to modulate neuronal excitability and network dynamics. Unlike magnetic stimulation, ultrasound can target deeper brain structures with millimeter precision. Research suggests it may influence neuroplasticity, brain oscillations, and functional connectivity. Clinical applications are still largely experimental, but early studies show promise in treating mood disorders, movement disorders, and chronic pain.",
