  "summary": "A non-invasive treatment using near- or far-infrared wavelengths to stimulate cellular repair, modulate inflammation, and enhance circulation.",
  "description": "Infrared light therapy uses wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum (typically 700–1,000+ nm for near-infrared, and 3,000–100,000 nm for far-infrared) to penetrate tissues and trigger photobiomodulation. Near-infrared wavelengths penetrate deeper into muscles, joints, and sometimes brain tissue, influencing mitochondrial activity and promoting cellular repair. Far-infrared primarily generates gentle heat, improving circulation and tissue flexibility. Both modes can modulate inflammation, reduce pain, and support recovery.\n\nIt is applied via LEDs, laser diodes, or infrared heat panels, often for musculoskeletal injuries, neuropathic pain, arthritis, and emerging mental health and neurorehabilitation contexts.",
