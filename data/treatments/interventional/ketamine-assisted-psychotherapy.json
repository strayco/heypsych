  "summary": "A combined approach where ketamine administration is integrated with structured psychotherapy sessions to enhance therapeutic outcomes, particularly for mood disorders, PTSD, and existential distress.",
  "description": "Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) merges the rapid neurobiological effects of ketamine with psychotherapeutic processing. The ketamine is typically given in low to moderate doses via oral, intranasal, or intramuscular routes, creating an altered state of consciousness that can facilitate emotional openness and neuroplasticity. Therapists then guide the patient through preparation, in-session support, and post-session integration to address core psychological patterns, trauma, and existential concerns. This differs from standard IV ketamine infusions by placing equal emphasis on the psychotherapeutic frame.",
