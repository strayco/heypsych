  "summary": "A non-invasive neuromodulation technique delivering weak magnetic fields to modulate brain activity, with emerging evidence for rapid mood improvement in depression and bipolar disorder.",
  "description": "Low-Field Magnetic Stimulation (LFMS) applies magnetic fields much weaker than those used in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), typically in the microtesla to millitesla range. It does not induce neuronal firing directly but is thought to modulate ongoing brain oscillations and network connectivity. LFMS sessions are short, painless, and do not require anesthesia, making it a potentially rapid-acting and well-tolerated option for mood disorders.",
