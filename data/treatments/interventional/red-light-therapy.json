  "summary": "A non-invasive treatment that uses red and near-infrared wavelengths of light to stimulate cellular repair, reduce inflammation, and improve healing.",
  "description": "Red light therapy (RLT), also known as low-level laser therapy (LLLT) or photobiomodulation, uses specific wavelengths of red and near-infrared light to stimulate mitochondrial activity and cellular repair. It is a non-invasive approach that has been studied for pain reduction, wound healing, skin rejuvenation, and neurological recovery. Unlike UV light, red light does not damage skin cells, and the therapy is generally considered safe when administered properly.",
