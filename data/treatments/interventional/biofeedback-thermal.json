  "summary": "A noninvasive biofeedback method that uses skin temperature monitoring to train relaxation and peripheral vasodilation as markers of parasympathetic activation.",
  "description": "Thermal biofeedback measures skin surface temperature—typically from a finger or toe—using sensitive thermistors or infrared sensors. Peripheral skin temperature reflects changes in blood flow, which is influenced by autonomic balance: stress and sympathetic activation cause vasoconstriction and cooling, while relaxation and parasympathetic activation promote vasodilation and warming.\n\nPatients learn to raise skin temperature through paced breathing, guided imagery, and relaxation strategies, often supported by visual feedback on a screen. This method is particularly useful in conditions where peripheral vasoconstriction plays a role, such as migraine, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and stress-related disorders.",
