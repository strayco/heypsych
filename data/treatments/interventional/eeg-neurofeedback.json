  "summary": "A non-invasive brain training method using real-time EEG feedback to help individuals learn to regulate their brain activity, applied in ADHD, anxiety, epilepsy, and other conditions.",
  "description": "EEG neurofeedback, also called EEG biofeedback or neurotherapy, uses electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brainwave activity and provides real-time feedback to the participant, often through visual or auditory cues. The participant learns to increase or decrease certain brainwave patterns associated with improved cognitive or emotional functioning.\n\nIt is used both as a therapeutic intervention for clinical conditions and as a performance enhancement tool. Protocols are tailored to the individual's EEG profile and treatment goals, and sessions are typically repeated over several weeks.",
