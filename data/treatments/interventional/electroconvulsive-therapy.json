  "summary": "A medical procedure in which controlled electrical currents are passed through the brain to intentionally trigger a brief seizure, used to treat severe psychiatric conditions when other treatments have failed or are unsafe.",
  "description": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe, highly effective treatment primarily for severe depression, treatment-resistant mood disorders, and certain psychotic illnesses. It involves the administration of a short, controlled electrical stimulus to the scalp under general anesthesia, producing a brief therapeutic seizure. Modern ECT is performed with muscle relaxants and continuous monitoring to minimize risks. The treatment often leads to rapid symptom improvement, making it especially valuable in urgent or life-threatening psychiatric conditions.",
