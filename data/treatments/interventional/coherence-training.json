  "summary": "A biofeedback-based intervention designed to improve physiological and emotional regulation by training individuals to achieve a state of heart rate variability (HRV) coherence.",
  "description": "Coherence training, often facilitated through heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback, teaches individuals to regulate their breathing, heart rhythms, and emotional states to achieve a state known as psychophysiological coherence. In this state, breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure patterns become synchronized, supporting improved autonomic nervous system balance.\n\nThis approach has applications in stress reduction, anxiety management, trauma recovery, and performance optimization. Sessions often use computer or wearable devices that measure HRV and provide visual or auditory feedback to guide the participant toward optimal breathing patterns (often ~6 breaths per minute).\n\nBy training consistent, rhythmic breathing and positive emotional focus, coherence training aims to enhance resilience, cognitive performance, and emotional stability.",
