  "summary": "An inhaled analgesic/anxiolytic gas (N₂O–O₂ mixture) administered in medical or dental settings; also under investigation as a rapid-acting antidepressant for treatment-resistant depression.",
  "description": "Nitrous oxide (N₂O) is a colorless gas with analgesic and anxiolytic properties used for minimal-to-moderate procedural sedation in dentistry, emergency/ambulatory care, and minor procedures. It is delivered as a controlled blend with oxygen via mask systems equipped with scavenging to prevent environmental exposure. At subanesthetic concentrations, N₂O modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission—principally via noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonism—producing rapid anxiolysis and analgesia.\n\nBeyond procedural use, several clinical trials suggest that brief inhalation of N₂O at controlled concentrations can produce rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. These effects may emerge within hours and persist for days to weeks in some patients. Use for mood disorders remains investigational and should occur in controlled clinical settings with appropriate screening and monitoring.",
