  "summary": "An investigational therapy using inhaled xenon gas as an anesthetic and neuroprotective agent, studied for depression, anxiety, and neuroprotection.",
  "description": "Xenon Therapy involves the controlled inhalation of xenon gas, a noble gas with established anesthetic properties and potential neuroprotective effects. Xenon acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, similar to ketamine, and may modulate glutamatergic signaling while providing neuroprotection against excitotoxicity. Clinically, it has been used in anesthesia and is being studied as a possible intervention for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and neuroprotection after traumatic brain injury. \n\nUnlike ketamine, xenon is chemically inert, rapidly eliminated through respiration, and does not undergo metabolic breakdown, contributing to a favorable safety profile. Research is still in early stages, and xenon therapy is not yet FDA-approved for psychiatric indications, though it shows promise as a novel neuromodulatory approach.",
