  "description": "Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) Neurofeedback is a specialized form of EEG-based biofeedback. It targets brain activity in the 12–15 Hz range, typically recorded over the sensorimotor cortex. Training patients to increase SMR activity is associated with improved sleep quality, reduced hyperactivity, enhanced attention, and decreased seizure susceptibility. It has been used in ADHD, insomnia, and epilepsy treatment, supported by decades of clinical application.",
