  "summary": "MDMA-assisted psychotherapy combines the empathogenic compound MDMA with structured psychotherapy to address PTSD, depression, and other conditions. Clinical trials suggest significant benefits, particularly in treatment-resistant PTSD.",
  "description": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a psychoactive compound known for its empathogenic and prosocial effects. In clinical settings, MDMA is paired with psychotherapy to facilitate trauma processing, emotional openness, and reduction of fear responses. Research, particularly through MAPS-sponsored trials, has demonstrated robust efficacy for severe, treatment-resistant PTSD. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is being investigated for depression, social anxiety, and substance use disorders. It is currently in late-stage clinical development and under FDA review.",
