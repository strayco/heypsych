  "summary": "Optogenetics is an advanced neuromodulation technique that uses light-sensitive proteins to control neural activity with millisecond precision. It is currently experimental in humans but has revolutionized neuroscience research and holds promise for treating psychiatric and neurological disorders.",
  "description": "Optogenetics combines genetic engineering and optics to achieve precise control of specific populations of neurons. By introducing opsins (light-sensitive ion channels) into targeted cells, researchers can activate or inhibit these neurons using pulses of light delivered through fiber-optic implants. This allows unprecedented control over neural circuits underlying mood, cognition, and behavior. Although widely used in animal models, translation to human therapy is at a very early stage due to challenges of genetic delivery, invasiveness, and safety. Potential applications include depression, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, PTSD, and addiction, making optogenetics a leading investigational approach in neuropsychiatry.",
