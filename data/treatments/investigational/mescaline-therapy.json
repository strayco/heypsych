  "summary": "Mescaline-assisted therapy uses the naturally occurring psychedelic alkaloid mescaline in combination with psychotherapy. Though less studied than psilocybin or MDMA, mescaline shows promise in treating depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.",
  "description": "Mescaline is a classic psychedelic alkaloid found in peyote, San Pedro, and Peruvian torch cacti. Historically used in Native American religious and healing practices, it produces profound alterations in perception, cognition, and emotional experience. Emerging modern research suggests mescaline may offer therapeutic benefits for depression, anxiety, and addiction when combined with structured psychotherapy. Scientific exploration is still at an early stage compared to psilocybin and MDMA, but growing interest in mescaline's long duration and spiritual quality of experiences is fueling investigational studies.",
