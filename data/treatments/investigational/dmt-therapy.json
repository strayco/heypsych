  "summary": "Investigational psychedelic-assisted therapy using N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a short-acting tryptamine hallucinogen. Studies explore its potential for depression, anxiety, addiction, and end-of-life distress.",
  "description": "DMT is a potent, fast-acting serotonergic psychedelic naturally occurring in plants and endogenous human metabolism. In therapeutic contexts, DMT is administered via intravenous or intramuscular routes, producing an intense but brief psychedelic state (5–30 minutes). Early-phase clinical studies and preclinical work suggest rapid effects on mood and neural plasticity, potentially offering a novel treatment for mental health disorders. Investigational protocols pair DMT with psychotherapy, preparation, and integration. Its extremely short duration differentiates it from psilocybin or LSD, raising interest in its potential as a more clinic-manageable psychedelic intervention.",

Preclinical evidence suggests DMT enhances neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and stress resilience. In therapy, the psychedelic state may facilitate breakthroughs in cognition, emotional regulation, and therapeutic alliance."
