  "summary": "Chemogenetics is an experimental technique that uses engineered receptors activated by otherwise inert designer drugs to modulate neuronal activity with high specificity. It is mainly explored in preclinical neuroscience research but is beginning to show translational potential for psychiatry and neurology.",
  "description": "Chemogenetics involves genetically engineering neurons to express Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). These engineered receptors respond only to specific synthetic ligands, such as clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), which are otherwise biologically inert. By selectively activating or silencing neuronal populations, researchers can precisely probe brain circuits underlying psychiatric and neurological disorders. While primarily a research tool, chemogenetics is being investigated for therapeutic applications in epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, depression, addiction, and chronic pain. Translation to humans faces significant hurdles, including safe gene delivery, receptor stability, and ethical considerations.",
