  "summary": "A noninvasive neuromodulation and lesioning technology using precisely targeted ultrasound energy to modulate or disrupt specific brain circuits. Investigated for treatment-resistant depression, OCD, essential tremor, and other neuropsychiatric disorders.",
  "description": "Focused Ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging neuromodulation modality that delivers acoustic energy through the skull to precise brain targets without open surgery. Depending on intensity and frequency, FUS can be used for noninvasive neuromodulation (low-intensity FUS, or LIFU) or permanent lesioning (high-intensity focused ultrasound, HIFU). MR-guided FUS allows real-time targeting and monitoring. Research applications in psychiatry include modulation of the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and striatum to reduce symptoms of depression, OCD, and anxiety, as well as permanent lesioning of circuits implicated in severe treatment-resistant cases.",
