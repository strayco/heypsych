  "summary": "Closed-loop neurostimulation is an emerging approach where neural activity is monitored in real time and stimulation is automatically adjusted based on feedback signals. It holds promise for conditions like epilepsy, depression, movement disorders, and chronic pain.",
  "description": "Unlike open-loop neuromodulation, which delivers stimulation continuously or in pre-set patterns, closed-loop neurostimulation dynamically adjusts its output based on recorded neural or physiological signals. Devices use sensors to detect abnormal brain or nervous system activity, and algorithms trigger or modulate stimulation accordingly. This responsive system aims to improve efficacy, minimize side effects, and extend device lifespan. Current clinical applications include the NeuroPace RNS® System for drug-resistant epilepsy and investigational systems for depression, Parkinson’s disease, and chronic pain.",
