  "summary": "A traditional Amazonian plant medicine containing DMT and harmala alkaloids, increasingly investigated for its therapeutic potential in depression, trauma, addiction, and existential distress.",
  "description": "Ayahuasca is a psychoactive brew prepared from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and the Psychotria viridis (or Diplopterys cabrerana) leaf. It combines β-carboline alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine) that act as MAO inhibitors with the psychedelic tryptamine DMT. In ceremonial and clinical contexts, ayahuasca induces intense visionary experiences, emotional catharsis, and altered states of consciousness. Early research and growing clinical interest suggest potential efficacy for treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, anxiety, and substance use disorders when combined with structured preparation and integration support.",
