  "description": "Ibogaine is a naturally occurring indole alkaloid found in the root bark of the African shrub *Tabernanthe iboga*. Traditionally used in Bwiti spiritual practices, it has gained attention for its purported ability to rapidly reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings in opioid and stimulant addiction. Its complex pharmacology includes interactions with NMDA, opioid, sigma, and serotonergic receptors, as well as modulation of neurotrophic factors. Despite anecdotal and early clinical evidence, ibogaine remains investigational due to serious safety concerns, especially cardiotoxicity and risk of fatal arrhythmias. Research continues into safer analogs such as noribogaine.",
