  "summary": "Psilocybin therapy involves the supervised use of psilocybin, a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms, to treat mental health disorders. It is being studied for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction, showing strong promise in clinical trials.",
  "description": "Psilocybin, the active compound in 'magic mushrooms', is a classic serotonergic psychedelic that acts primarily as a 5-HT2A receptor agonist. In a therapeutic context, psilocybin is administered in a controlled, supportive environment, often accompanied by psychotherapy. Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid and sustained antidepressant and anxiolytic effects after only one or two sessions. Research also suggests potential in treating substance use disorders and existential distress in terminally ill patients. Psilocybin therapy remains investigational but is among the most advanced psychedelic-assisted treatments approaching potential regulatory approval.",
