  "summary": "Viral vector gene therapy uses modified viruses to deliver therapeutic genes into a patient's cells. In psychiatry and neurology, this investigational approach seeks to correct dysfunctional pathways by introducing or regulating gene expression relevant to mental health disorders.",
  "description": "Viral vector gene therapy is an investigational approach that leverages engineered viruses—such as adeno-associated virus (AAV), lentivirus, or retrovirus—to deliver therapeutic genetic material into specific brain regions. The goal is to restore or modulate neural function by altering gene expression. While gene therapies are established in rare monogenic neurological diseases, their application to psychiatric conditions is still highly experimental. Early-stage studies suggest potential for disorders such as major depression, addiction, and neurodegenerative diseases, though safety, specificity, and ethical concerns remain significant challenges.",
