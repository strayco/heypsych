  "summary": "Multimodal antidepressants combine serotonin reuptake inhibition with additional receptor activity to produce broader therapeutic effects. These agents are designed to improve efficacy and tolerability compared to traditional SSRIs or SNRIs.",
  "description": "Unlike traditional SSRIs and SNRIs, multimodal antidepressants act on multiple neurotransmitter systems simultaneously. For example, vortioxetine and vilazodone not only inhibit serotonin reuptake but also directly modulate serotonin receptor subtypes. This approach aims to enhance antidepressant efficacy, improve cognitive symptoms, and reduce side effects like sexual dysfunction. Research continues to evaluate the comparative benefits of these newer medications over conventional antidepressants.",
