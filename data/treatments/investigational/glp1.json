  "description": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion, slow gastric emptying, and reduce appetite. Beyond metabolic effects, GLP-1 receptors are expressed in brain regions involved in reward, motivation, and mood (e.g., VTA, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex). Early clinical and preclinical research suggests potential benefits for major depressive disorder, anhedonia, cognitive impairment, and substance use disorders by modulating dopamine signaling, reducing neuroinflammation, and improving metabolic health. Psychiatric applications remain investigational.",
