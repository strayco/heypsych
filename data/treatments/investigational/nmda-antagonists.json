  "summary": "NMDA receptor antagonists modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission and have shown rapid-acting antidepressant effects, particularly in treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine and its derivative esketamine are the most studied agents.",
  "description": "NMDA antagonists act on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor critical in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. By modulating glutamate signaling, these drugs can induce rapid antidepressant effects, sometimes within hours. Ketamine, delivered intravenously, and intranasal esketamine are the leading examples, with FDA approval for treatment-resistant depression and depressive symptoms in major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation. Other NMDA antagonists, including investigational agents like rapastinel and apimostinel, are being studied to achieve similar efficacy with improved safety and tolerability.",
