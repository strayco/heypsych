  "summary": "Investigational small-molecule compounds that positively modulate AMPA receptors to enhance glutamatergic signaling, synaptic plasticity, and cognition, with potential antidepressant and pro-cognitive effects.",
  "description": "AMPA modulators—often called 'ampakines' or AMPA positive allosteric modulators (PAMs)—increase the activity of AMPA-type glutamate receptors without directly activating them. By slowing receptor desensitization and/or deactivation, these agents can strengthen excitatory neurotransmission, promote long-term potentiation (LTP), and upregulate neurotrophic factors such as BDNF. A growing pipeline of AMPA PAMs is being investigated for major depressive disorder, cognitive impairment, schizophrenia (negative/cognitive symptoms), attention disorders, and other neuropsychiatric conditions.",
