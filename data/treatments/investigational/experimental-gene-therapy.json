  "description": "Experimental gene therapy for mental health aims to alter gene expression or introduce corrective genetic material in specific neural circuits. Approaches include AAV- or lentiviral-based gene delivery, RNA interference (siRNA/shRNA), antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), and programmable systems for transcriptional tuning (e.g., CRISPRi/a) delivered via adeno-associated virus or lipid nanoparticles. Targets span stress-response signaling, monoaminergic transporters and receptors, glutamatergic plasticity genes, neurotrophic factors, and synaptic scaffolding proteins. While gene therapy is established in some non-psychiatric conditions, psychiatric applications face unique challenges: polygenic risk architecture, cell-type specificity, durable yet controllable expression, blood–brain barrier delivery, and ethical safeguards.",
