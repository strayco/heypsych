  "summary": "An investigational psychedelic-assisted therapy using 5-MeO-DMT, a short-acting tryptamine that can induce profound non-ordinary states of consciousness with potential transdiagnostic benefits when combined with preparation and integration therapy.",
  "description": "5-MeO-DMT therapy involves the carefully screened, clinically supervised administration of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine. The compound produces a rapid-onset, ultra-short psychedelic experience often characterized by ego dissolution and non-dual awareness. Early research and observational reports suggest potential benefits for depression, anxiety, trauma-related symptoms, and existential distress. Because of the experience’s intensity, rigorous preparation, risk screening, medical safeguards, and structured integration are essential.",
