  "description": "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves transferring processed stool from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal tract of a recipient. This therapy aims to reestablish microbial diversity and function, which may be disrupted in various diseases. While already established for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, FMT is being investigated in psychiatry and neurology for conditions such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, and Parkinson’s disease, based on evidence linking gut microbiota to brain function via the gut–brain axis.",
