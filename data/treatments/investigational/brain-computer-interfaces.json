  "summary": "Brain-computer interfaces are investigational technologies that enable direct communication between the brain and external devices, with applications in neurorehabilitation, assistive communication, and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",
  "description": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that establish a direct pathway between brain activity and external devices such as computers, prosthetics, or stimulation systems. They may be invasive (implanted electrodes) or non-invasive (EEG, MEG, fNIRS). BCIs are being explored for restoring communication in paralyzed patients, enhancing motor recovery after stroke, controlling neuroprosthetics, and modulating brain activity in psychiatric conditions. Research is ongoing to determine safety, reliability, and therapeutic efficacy across diverse conditions.",
