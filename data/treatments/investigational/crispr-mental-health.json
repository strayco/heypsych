  "description": "CRISPR-based therapeutics use programmable nucleases and effectors to edit DNA or regulate gene expression. While CRISPR has advanced rapidly in monogenic and systemic diseases, psychiatric applications remain investigational due to polygenic risk, complex brain circuitry, and delivery barriers to the CNS. Approaches under study include in vivo CRISPR gene editing, CRISPR interference/activation (CRISPRi/a) for transcriptional tuning, base and prime editing for precise changes, and RNA-targeting systems. Targets of interest include stress-response genes (e.g., FKBP5), serotonergic and glutamatergic pathways (e.g., SLC6A4, GRIN genes), neuroplasticity regulators (e.g., BDNF), and epigenetic marks linked to trauma. Translation requires safe, cell-type–specific delivery (AAV, LNP, engineered capsids), rigorous off-target profiling, and ethical safeguards.",
