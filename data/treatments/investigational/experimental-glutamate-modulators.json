  "description": "Glutamate is the brain’s primary excitatory neurotransmitter, central to synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, and mood regulation. Dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling has been implicated in depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, and schizophrenia. Experimental glutamate modulators explore a wide range of mechanisms—beyond ketamine and esketamine (already FDA-approved)—such as NMDA receptor subunit–selective antagonists (e.g., NR2B-selective), glycine-site modulators, AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulators (AMPAR PAMs), mGluR2/3 agonists or antagonists, and triple reuptake inhibitors with glutamatergic activity. The aim is to achieve rapid, durable antidepressant and anxiolytic effects without dissociation or abuse liability.",
