  "summary": "Novel antidepressants encompass emerging classes of medications with mechanisms of action distinct from traditional SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs. These agents target glutamatergic, serotonergic, opioid, and neurotrophic pathways to provide faster, more effective, and tolerable treatments for depression.",
  "description": "Novel antidepressants represent a new wave of pharmacological strategies for mood disorders, particularly treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Unlike conventional antidepressants, which primarily act on monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine), these therapies focus on alternative systems, including NMDA receptor modulation, AMPA potentiation, kappa-opioid receptor antagonism, and neurotrophic pathways such as BDNF signaling. Examples include esketamine (NMDA antagonist, FDA-approved), zuranolone (neurosteroid modulator), and investigational compounds like rapastinel, an NMDA partial agonist, and SAGE-217. They hold promise for rapid-acting effects, better safety profiles, and improved outcomes in TRD and comorbid psychiatric conditions.",
