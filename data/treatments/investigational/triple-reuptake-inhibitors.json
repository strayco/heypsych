  "summary": "Triple reuptake inhibitors (TRIs) are investigational antidepressants that simultaneously block the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This mechanism aims to provide broader efficacy in treating depression, particularly treatment-resistant cases, by targeting all three major monoamine systems.",
  "description": "Unlike SSRIs and SNRIs, which selectively increase serotonin and/or norepinephrine, triple reuptake inhibitors (TRIs) enhance signaling across serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine pathways. The theoretical advantage is a more robust antidepressant effect, potentially reducing anhedonia and cognitive impairment that are less responsive to conventional agents. Several TRIs, such as amitifadine (EB-1010), have undergone clinical investigation, though none are yet FDA-approved. Safety and tolerability profiles remain under study, with concerns about stimulant-like side effects due to dopamine reuptake inhibition.",
