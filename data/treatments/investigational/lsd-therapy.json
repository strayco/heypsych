  "summary": "LSD-assisted psychotherapy uses the psychedelic compound LSD to facilitate deep psychological processing and potentially treat conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. Clinical research is ongoing after decades of prohibition.",
  "description": "LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a potent serotonergic psychedelic that profoundly alters perception, cognition, and sense of self. When administered in a controlled therapeutic setting, LSD is paired with psychotherapy to facilitate emotional release, enhanced self-reflection, and potential restructuring of maladaptive cognitive and behavioral patterns. Current research focuses on LSD-assisted therapy for anxiety associated with life-threatening illness, treatment-resistant depression, cluster headaches, and substance use disorders. While promising, LSD therapy remains investigational and highly regulated.",
